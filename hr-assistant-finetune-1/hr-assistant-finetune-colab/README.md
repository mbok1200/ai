# HR Assistant Fine-Tune Project

This project is designed to fine-tune a language model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques. The main components of the project include the training script, dataset, and a Google Colab notebook for easy execution.

## Files Description

- **src/train_lora.py**: This script contains the implementation for training a LoRA model. It includes:
  - Model setup using Hugging Face Transformers
  - LoRA configuration
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Training logic

- **data/merged_min.jsonl**: This file is a JSON Lines formatted dataset that includes training examples. Each example consists of:
  - `instruction`: The task to be performed
  - `input`: The input data for the task
  - `output`: The expected output
  - `metadata`: Additional information, including source URLs

- **LoRA_Training_Colab.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook is designed for use in Google Colab. It provides:
  - Environment setup instructions
  - Code to load the dataset
  - Execution of the training process using the code from `train_lora.py`

## Getting Started

To run this project in Google Colab:

1. Open the `LoRA_Training_Colab.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up the environment and load the dataset.
3. Execute the cells to train the LoRA model.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the following dependencies in your Colab environment:

- `torch`
- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `peft`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
!pip install torch transformers datasets peft
```
