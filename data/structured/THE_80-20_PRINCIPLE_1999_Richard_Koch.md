Praise for The 80/20 Principle “The 80/20 Principle is the cornerstone of results-based living. Read this book and use it.” —Tim Ferriss, author of The 4-Hour Workweek “Time management is not about organizing your daily tasks, it is

about organizing your essential daily tasks, and dumping the rest. Koch has made millions from this—a bestseller based on just one idea—proving that it works.” —GQ’s 25 Best Business Books “The 80/20 Principle is terrific!”

—Al Ries, bestselling author of Focus and Positioning “Both astute and entertaining, this is an intriguing book to help people concentrate on not wasting their lives.” —Professor Theodore Zeldin, St. Antony’s College, Oxford University

“We give this Dali-esque masterwork 5 stars…a beautiful collage of well-written prose…This book is worth many times its price.” —Weston Review, Tampa Bay, Florida Although the author expresses a view on the likely future performance of certain

investment instruments, this should not be taken as an incitement to deal in any of them, nor is it to be regarded as investment advice. Each individual should consider their investment position in relation to their own circumstances with the benefit of professional

advice. No responsibility can be assumed by either the author or the publisher for investment or any other decision taken on the basis of views expressed in this book. Copyright © 1997, 1998, 2007, 2017 by Richard Koch

PART FIVE: THE PRINCIPLE REVISITED 20  The Two Dimensions of the Principle Notes and References About the Author PREFACE TO THE EXPANDED AND UPDATED EDITION The 80/20 Principle is marching on—not just this book, but the

principle itself. In the past ten to twenty years, there have been incredibly significant changes in business, society, our personal lives, and in our understanding of how and why the 80/20 Principle operates. This has required a major addition to the book.

The principle has never been as ubiquitous or important as it is now. In the past, the principle gave those who used it a serious advantage. In the future it will be an essential tool—and probably the essential tool—for anyone who wants to succeed or be happy.

So what has happened in the past few years? Briefly, three things: 1 Top-down and large organizations are giving way—at least in the ability to generate high growth, profits, and cash—to networks, and to network ventures such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Uber,

Amazon, eBay, and Betfair. These kinds of networks and network organizations are coming to dominate society and this is why 80/20 is becoming more prevalent. All networks exhibit positive feedback loops—the big get bigger,

the rich get richer, the famous get more famous, and networks benefiting the world (such as network businesses and the philanthropic organizations they often spawn) and those not benefiting the world (such as drug gangs and ISIS) become

wealthier and more powerful. The new Chapter 17 says what networks and network businesses are, and why nobody in their right mind—if they are ambitious— would work for anything but a network or a network business.

2 The 80/20 pattern that we have come to recognize for over a century—and which has been remarkably consistent, varying mainly between, say, 70/30 and 90/10—is rapidly increasing to 90/10 and 99/1. The new Chapter 18 describes how the lopsided distribution of

causes and results is becoming more acute, as improbable events and rapid transformation of fortunes become more possible and influential. 3 There are a few rules of thumb that make all the difference between success and failure, between personal fulfillment and

personal angst, and between happiness and misery. The new Chapter 19 describes five mega-rules to live by. There is one more thing that I have discovered. The greatest manifestation of 80/20 was not included in the early editions of

this book. A new Chapter 16 describes “Your Hidden Friend,” which can exert a super-potent and amazingly favorable influence on your life. The hidden friend operates at extraordinary speed and impact for no conscious effort at all. And properly trained,

your hidden friend can transform your life. This requires a little effort—the trick is to know how to do the training, the coding, of your hidden friend. Chapter 16 describes how. So there we have it. Four great new chapters. Go forth and shout

the good news about the principle from the rooftops. The 80/20 Principle has already sold more than a million copies in thirty-six languages. I dare to hope and expect that this new edition —which I think is more valuable—will multiply that record.

For what has already been achieved, I am profoundly grateful to you, the readers—the beneficiaries, perhaps, but also the evangelists. I know from your messages and e-mails how mind-blowing so many of you are finding the principle. Long may it continue, and thank you

all so much. I may have touched your lives, but you have certainly touched mine, and I am most grateful. Richard Koch richardkoch8020@gmail.com Gibraltar, March 2017 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This has been the most painful and well-researched book I have ever

written. There is a certain irony here, since the 80/20 Principle tells us that I could have obtained a book 80 percent as good in 20 percent of the time. This would certainly have been my inclination,

and only the reader can tell whether the extra effort has been worthwhile. I think it has, but I have lost all objectivity. The effort involved has been much more collective than for any of my previous books. Don’t believe the false modesty of those who

write generously that their books have been “team efforts.” In the end only an author (or authors) can write a book. But I want to thank some individuals without whom this book would either not have existed or would have been vastly inferior.

First is Mark Allin, then at Pitman Publishing and now my partner in Capstone Publishing, who first had the idea of the book. Second is Nicholas Brealey, who has put so much intelligent effort into this book that I sincerely hope it pays off for him! According to

the Von Manstein principle (see Chapter 13), people like Nicholas who are smart and industrious will not be as successful as those who are smart and lazy. To become a real star, Nicholas must work a great deal less. I have a theory that if he published half the number of

books, and put all his effort into these, he’d make even more money. I hope my next book will not be one to get the axe! I am very grateful for his persistence on this book. Sally Lansdell Yeung has been the “third person” collaborating to

get the structure and text right. She is clearly a gifted publisher in her own right. Next, my researcher on the book, Nick Oosterlinck, did a terrific job of reconstructing the history of the 80/20 Principle from 1897 to

## He has now disappeared from my radar screen, but if he would like to get in touch I would be delighted to dispense some champagne his way. I should also thank not only Mr. Pareto for originating the 80/20


Principle, but also Mr. Juran, Mr. Zipf, Mr. Krugman, and the unsung heroes at IBM in the 1960s for elaborating it. And also the hundreds of people from all walks of life and disciplines who have written magazine articles about the 80/20 Principle, many of whom

I have quoted extensively as evidence of the way in which the principle can be used. I have made every effort to acknowledge these people in the references, but if there are any omissions please accept

my apologies and let me know so that correction can by made in any future editions. I am particularly grateful to David Parker, lecturer in managerial economics and business strategy at the University of

Birmingham Business School, whose work on the application of chaos theory to business strategy is full of brilliant insights, many of which I have appropriated. Finally, every true believer needs his trusted skeptics. Patrick

Weaver and Lee Dempsey have fulfilled this role admirably, and it is much appreciated. PART ONE OVERTURE The Universe Is Wonky! What is the 80/20 Principle? The 80/20 Principle tells us that in any population, some things are likely to be much

more important than others. A good benchmark or hypothesis is that 80 percent of results or outputs flow from 20 percent of causes, and sometimes from a much smaller proportion of powerful forces. Everyday language is a good illustration. Sir Isaac

Pitman, who invented shorthand, discovered that just 700 common words make up two-thirds of our conversation. Including the derivatives of these words, Pitman found that these words account for 80 percent of

common speech. In this case, fewer than 1 percent of words (the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary lists over half a million words) are used 80 percent of the time. We could call this an 80/1 principle. Similarly,

over 99 percent of talk uses fewer than 20 percent of words: we could call this a 99/20 relationship. The movies illustrate the 80/20 Principle. A recent study shows that 1.3 percent of movies earn 80 percent
