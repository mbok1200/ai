Preface Each time work begins on a new edition of The Standard for Project Management and the PMBOK® Guide, there is an opportunity to consider global perspectives on changes in project management and the approaches used for realizing benefits and value from project outputs. In

the time between every edition, a world of change has occurred. Some organizations have ceased to exist, and new organizations have emerged. Older technologies have reached end of life while technologies offering completely new capabilities have evolved. People who continue in the

workforce have advanced their thinking, skills, and capabilities as new entrants focus on quickly understanding their professional language, building their skills, developing their business acumen, and contributing to the objectives of their employers.

Even in the midst of such changes, though, there are fundamental concepts and constructs that remain in place. The understanding that collective thinking produces more holistic solutions than the thoughts of one individual continues. And the fact that organizations use projects as

a vehicle for delivering a unique result or output endures. CUSTOMER- AND END-USER-CENTERED DESIGN While the Sixth Edition of the PMBOK® Guide was under development and throughout development of this Seventh Edition, PMI has actively engaged with a broad range of global stakeholders on their

experiences with using The Standard for Project Management and the PMBOK® Guide. These engagements have included: ▶ Online surveys to representative samples of PMI stakeholders; ▶ Focus groups with PMO leaders, project managers, agile practitioners, project team

members, and educators and trainers; and ▶ Interactive workshops with practitioners at various PMI events around the globe. PMI Seventh Edition July 2021 viii The feedback and inputs collectively emphasized four key points:

▶ Maintain and enhance the credibility and relevance of the PMBOK® Guide. ▶ Improve the readability and usefulness of the PMBOK® Guide while avoiding overstuffing it with new content. ▶ Sense stakeholder information and content needs and provide vetted supplemental

content supporting practical application. ▶ Recognize that there is continued value for some stakeholders in the structure and content of previous editions so that any shifts enhance without negating that value.

SUSTAINING THE RELEVANCE OF THE PMBOK ® GUIDE Since its inception as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) in 1987, A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) has evolved while recognizing that fundamental

elements of project management endure. Its evolution has not just involved an increase in the page count, it has also involved significant and substantive changes in the nature of the content. A sampling

of some of those key changes is reflected in the following table: PMI Seventh Edition July 2021 ix Evolution of Key Changes in the PMBOK® Guide PMBOK® Guide Edition Key Evolutionary Changes • Distinguished as “a guide to the body of knowledge,” rather than the body of knowledge for project

management. • Reflected the subset of the project management body of knowledge that is “generally accepted,” meaning applicable to most projects most of the time with widespread consensus that practices have

value and usefulness. • Defined project management as “the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities in order to meet or exceed stakeholder needs and expectations [emphasis added] from

a project.” • Specific decision to shift to a process-based standard driven by a desire to show interactions among Knowledge Areas; create a robust and flexible structure; and recognize that ISO and other standards

organizations were establishing process-based standards. • First edition to incorporate the “ANSI Standard” logo on the cover. • First edition to formally designate The Standard for Project Management of a Project separate and

distinct from the Project Management Framework and Body of Knowledge. • Included material “generally recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time.” • Defined project management as “the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project

activities to meet the project requirements.” • First edition to make a distinct separation between the ANSI standard and the guide. • First time “agile” content is incorporated into the text, not just referenced in examples.

• Expansion of Knowledge Area front material, including key concepts, trends and emerging practices, tailoring considerations, and considerations for agile/adaptive environments. 1996 Third (2004) Sixth (2017)

PMI Seventh Edition July 2021 x Like previous editions of The Standard for Project Management and the PMBOK® Guide, this edition recognizes that the project management landscape continues to evolve and adapt. Over the

past 10 years alone, the advancement of software into all types of products, services, and solutions has grown exponentially. What software can enable continues to change as artificial intelligence, cloud-based capabilities, and new business models drive innovation and new ways of working.
