Advance Praise for The Culture Map “Erin Meyer provides us with a brilliant guide to what all business leaders need to know right now: How to succeed in managing across the diverse cultural contexts of today’s

workplace!” —Marshall Goldsmith, author of the New York Times and global bestseller What Got You Here Won’t Get You There “Whether you are sitting at a desk in Boston or eating at a restaurant in Beijing, communicating across cultures is the

great challenge of the global economy. Getting it right will be the diﬀerence between success and failure. Erin Meyer shows you how to get it right in this very important book. Managers everywhere should read it.”

—Des Dearlove and Stuart Crainer, founders, Thinkers50 “I highly recommend this book to both the professional and leisure reader. Erin has shown herself to be one of the main representativesof the next-generation

scholars who combine deep conceptual models with very practical applications. A must-read!” —Fons Trompenaars, author of Riding the Waves of Culture “Although we live in an increasingly digitally connected and

virtual business world, The Culture Map reminds us that understanding cultural diﬀerences in human interactions still matters. Global leaders know that blending cultural and individual diversity in teams is a sure recipe for better

business outcomes. But this diversity needs to be ﬁrst understood and then proactively managed. Meyer presents a brave, research-based analysis of how to do just that. With clear and practical frameworks, The Culture Map will

help business leaders become ‘cultural bridge builders’ to the beneﬁt of their teams and organizations.” —Dr. Didier CL Bonnet, global head of practices, Capgemini Consulting “Commerce may be global but culture isn’t. Erin Meyer’s

The Culture Map reminds us that behind businesses there are people who have biases, expectations, and a view of life which can unexpectedly determine and form multimillion- dollar decisions. Understanding that culture shapes people

who shape business is vital to win. This is the book you need to travel with everywhere if you are serious about going global.” —Pedro Pina, head of brand solutions, Europe, Google “The book abounds with well-chosen anecdotes to illustrate

the misunderstandings that can arise from clashing cultural assumptions, making this enlightening book a pleasure to read.” —Foreign Aﬀairs “Whether you’re a corporate or traditional diplomat, global traveler, government oﬀicial, or passionate world citizen,

this is the one book you should not miss. Chock-full of real- world examples and a simple framework that can be utilized in any cross-cultural context, Meyer’s work is characterized by a fresh and relevant voice, distilling down

the essentials of communicating, persuading and working eﬀectively around the globe. It is rare that I pick up a cross-cultural book and can’t put it down.” —Cari Guittard, Huﬀington Post “This readable book explains how to dramatically increase

organisational success by improving our ability to understand the behaviour of colleagues, clients, and suppliers from diﬀerent countries.” —Professional Manager (UK) “A helpful guide to working eﬀectively with people from

othercultures. . . . Meyer delivers important reading for those engaged in international business.” —Kirkus Reviews “With business becoming ever global, there are a raft of books available on dealing with cultural diﬀerences. If you

only read one, make it INSEAD professor Erin Meyer’s. . . . [She s]killfully blend[s] real-life examples . . . with an analytical framework. . . . What brings this book to life are the numerous examples Meyerhas encountered, both in her

own life as an American living in Paris, and in her experience running the Managing Virtual Teams module at INSEAD.” —HR Magazine, 5 star review “Amusing.” —Financial Times “In a relaxed, entertaining, but always knowledgeable style,

Meyer draws on numerous examples from her experiences to explain how to detect the invisible barriers in the global business world—and how to get past them.” —Siemens Industry Journal THE CULTURE MAP Copyright © 2014 by Erin Meyer.

new client. I hadn’t slept well, but that was nothing unusual, since before an important training session I often have a restless night. But what made this night diﬀerent were the dreams that disturbed my sleep.

I found myself shopping for groceries in a big American- style supermarket. As I worked my way through my list— fruit, Kleenex, more fruit, a loaf of bread, a container of milk, still more fruit—I was startled to discover that the

items were somehow disappearing from my cart more quickly than I could ﬁnd them and stack them in the basket. I raced down the aisle of the store, grabbing goods and tossing them into my cart, only to see them vanish without a

trace. Horriﬁed and frustrated, I realized that my shopping would never be complete. After having this dream repeatedly throughout the night, I gave up trying to sleep. I got up, gulped a cup of coﬀee and got dressed in the predawn dark, and wound my way

through the empty Paris streets to my oﬀice near the Champs Elysées to prepare for that day’s program. Reﬂecting that my nightmare of ineﬀectual shopping might reﬂect my anxiety about being completely ready for my

clients, I poured my energy into arranging the conference room and reviewing my notes for the day ahead. I would be spending the day with one of the top executives at Peugeot Citroën, preparing him and his wife for the cultural

adjustments they’d need to make in their upcoming move to Wuhan, China. If the program was successful, my ﬁrm would be hired to provide the same service for another ﬁfty couples later in the year, so there was a lot at stake.

Bo Chen, the Chinese country expert who would be assisting with the training session, also arrived early. Chen, a thirty-six-year-old Paris-based journalist from Wuhan, worked for a Chinese newspaper. He had volunteered to act

as a Chinese culture expert for the training, and his input would be one of the most critical elements in making the day a success. If he was as good as I hoped, the program would be a hit and we would get to conduct the ﬁfty follow-

up sessions. My conﬁdence in Chen had been bolstered by our preparatory meetings. Articulate, extroverted, and very knowledgeable, Chen seemed perfect for the job. I had asked him to prepare two to three concrete business

examples to illustrate each cultural dimension I would be covering during the program, and he had enthusiastically conﬁrmed he would be ready. Monsieur and Madame Bernard arrived, and I installed them on one side of the big glass rectangular table with

Chen on the other side. Taking a deep, hopeful breath, I began the session, outlining on a ﬂip chart the cultural issues that the Bernards needed to grasp so their time in China would be a success. As the morning wore on, I

explained each dimension of the key issues, answered the Bernards’ questions, and carefully kept an eye on Chen so I could help facilitate his input. But Chen didn’t seem to have any input. After ﬁnishing

the ﬁrst dimension, I paused brieﬂy and looked to him for his input, but he didn’t speak up. He didn’t open his mouth, move his body forward, or raise his hand. Apparently he had no example to provide. Not wanting to embarrass Chen or to

create an awkward situation by calling on him when he was not ready, I simply continued with my next point. To my growing dismay, Chen remained silent and nearly motionless as I went through the rest of my presentation.

He nodded politely while I was speaking, but that was all; he used no other body language to indicate any reactions, positive or negative. I gave every example I could think of and engaged in dialogue with the client as best I could.

Dimension after dimension, I spoke, shared, and consulted with the Bernards—and dimension after dimension, there was no input from Chen. I continued for three full hours. My initial disappointment with Chen was spilling over into full-ﬂedged

panic. I needed his input for the program to succeed. Finally, although I didn’t want to create an awkward moment in front of the client, I decided to take a chance. “Bo,” I asked, “did you have any examples you would like to

share?” Chen sat up straight in his chair, smiled conﬁdently at the clients, and opened up his notebook, which was ﬁlled with pages and pages of typed notes. “Thank you, Erin,” he replied. “I do.” And then, to my utter relief, Chen began to

explain one clear, pertinent, fascinating example after another. In reﬂecting on the story of my awkward engagement with “Silent Bo,” it’s natural to assume that something about Chen’s personality, my personality, or the interaction

between us might have led to the strained situation. Perhaps Chen was mute because he is not a very good communicator, or because he is shy or introverted and doesn’t feel comfortable expressing himself until pushed. Or

perhaps I am an incompetent facilitator, telling Chen to prepare for the meeting and then failing to call on him until the session was almost over. Or maybe, more charitably, I was just so tired from dreaming about lost fruit all night

long that I missed the visual cues Chen was sending to indicate that he had something to say. In fact, my previous meetings with Chen had made it clear to me that he was neither inarticulate nor shy; he was
