How to Run Effective Meetings: The 10
Step Guide
Like creating a business website, meetings should be a productive tool for your company’s overall success,
right? Yet more often than not many people feel that they are a huge waste of their time.
The most common issues include people running late, not knowing who the leader is, an unclear reason for
the hosting of the meeting in the first place, and attendants wondering if they could’ve just received this
information over email instead. Despite the ‘haters,’ there’s something to be said about the powerful interaction
of meeting face-to-face.
The optimal objective should be to still host your business meetings when appropriate, while making sure that
they do in fact serve the best interests of every participant’s job duties and use of time. In this guide, we’ll
show you how to run a meeting that does just this.
Here’s everything you need to note about running effective meetings:
Decide whether or not to host the meeting
Set an agenda in advance

## Decide whether or not to host the meeting


Whether you are a small business owner with a minimal team or a large-scale operation managing remote
employees, the type of meeting you’re hosting sets the tone for everything, from the agenda to who should be
invited. Is this a repetitive weekly or monthly meeting where teammates speak about their current and ongoing
projects? Or is it an irregular meeting set to discuss a special project or sensitive information? Whichever is
the case, decide if having a meeting is your most effective option.
For repetitive meetings, sometimes it’s not worthwhile to host it. If you’re doing so out of formality, such as the
obligatory weekly update meetings, ask yourself if it makes more sense to just send an email with all the
information instead. Then, allow smaller groups to meet to discuss their relevant projects together when
appropriate. This will save everyone time and probably result in a sigh of relief for your ex-attendees.
For irregular meetings revolving around specific updates or projects, it will almost certainly make sense that
you do in fact hold a meeting. The information you’re sharing is new to all parties involved, and, therefore,
probably worth their time and attention to bring them on board and in line with your ideas and game plan.

## Set an agenda in advance


The golden rule of effective meetings: Don’t waste people’s time.
One of the habits of successful people is to ensure that you stick to the rules and have good oral
communication. So, you’ll want to establish an objective such as, “This meeting is being held to discuss plans
for the upcoming marketing campaign.” Okay, great! You are hosting a meeting with a true purpose. That’s
step one.
Now, write out an agenda beginning with that purpose bolded at the very top. Next, include bulleted points
explaining what you’ll discuss in the meeting. This is sort of a sneak peek that gives your attendees a clear
idea of what to expect, and also gives them the opportunity to prepare any materials or questions they have

ahead of time. You can write your agenda in the form of a handout or email, which you’ll deliver in advance.
And by ‘in advance,’ this means more than a day before, not just a few minutes.
When attendees show up to the meeting, have this agenda also visible somewhere in the room for them to
easily spot. Both them and you will want to reference it throughout the meeting to stay focused and on track.
You can print out a handout again, or put it on a presentation screen or a white board (and also save the
environment while you’re at it).

## Review your guest list


One vital checklist item to do is make sure that every single person will benefit from this meeting is by
reviewing your guest list. First, you want to make sure that everyone that should be invited is.
After setting your clear intentions for the agenda, you’ll be able to pinpoint which people at your company are
necessary to invite based on their connection to those responsibilities. Without key players in decision-making
processes around, you won’t be able to drive effective results from your meeting.
On the other side, the ‘not wasting anyone's time’ side, check that you didn’t invite people that don’t need to be
there. For example, did you plan to invite someone to the meeting just out of formality reasons? You’ll actually

be doing them a huge favor by opening up that time slot in their day.

## Start and end on time


The epitome of professionalism, entrepreneurship and good business is punctuality.
Nothing is more unprofessional than coming late to a business meeting that you called, that’s a fact. Respect
your guests’ time by showing up at least five minutes before the scheduled meeting time. This will set the tone,
as well as allow you to start on time if any technicalities come up.
Once the clock strikes meeting hour, start immediately. Another way to emphasize your intent for timeliness is
to not wait on guests that are late. By doing so, they will learn that in future business meetings with you,
tardiness is not acceptable behavior.
Then, only allow the meeting to run until the end time you scheduled. Everyone has other places to be or tasks
to do, so don’t allow your meeting to run over and interfere with those priorities. If you didn’t get through all of
your material, you can determine if it’s necessary to host another meeting, or if placing this content in the
follow-up email is sufficient.

## Manage the time in between


As the business meeting host, it’s your duty to make sure that the agenda is followed and that everything is
going according to plan. To ensure that you start and end when you’re supposed to, you’ll need to keep track
of your ordered goals and the time.
Here, it’s also super important to make sure that you don’t get off-topic. Naturally, this does happen, we are all
human of course. Even so, it doesn’t mean that it’s impossible to switch back into the right gear. An easy fix is
to save a space on the white board or designate a meeting attendee to mark down these items that are
brought up as ‘come back to later’ in order to allow time for the intended discussion points to be addressed
first.

## Take notes throughout


The main point of taking notes during the meeting is to make sure that you address concerns and tasks
requested from you afterwards. You should also request that the attendees do the same, and preferably on
pen and paper to avoid distractions.
If it’s too much for you to write and host, you can assign an attendee to take minutes (an almost word-for-word
written summary of the meeting’s discussion) or condensed notes of the topics covered. After the meeting,
you’ll be able to share it with the attendees for them to go over, or extend it to the people that couldn’t make it
but need to catch up.

## Save time for questions


When planning your time for each agenda item of the meeting, also save a space for questions. As you’ll find
yourself strictly staying on topic after accounting for the points in this guide (we hope!), a designated question
time will make room for some flexibility. In other words, it will allow attendees to have their opinions heard and
clarify anything that they didn’t understand. Plus, when you let your attendees know that you have reserved a
time for questions, there’s a smaller chance that you’ll be interrupted at other moments during the meeting.

## Conclude with action items


Again, it’s important to save a space. Your action items define why you held this meeting in the first place. It’s
important to keep in mind that effective meetings should always come with intentions in order to drive results.
Action items are everything that you want to come out of your meeting, such as deadlines, goals, and
highlights, as well as assigned attendees who are relevant to each of those things.

## Reevaluate the effectiveness


After your meeting, it’s time to reflect. Ask yourself if, in your opinion, the meeting produced the results you
intended it to. Do you feel that you were able to get your point across? Do you feel that attendees were
engaged and responsive? These are all important components of running effective meetings.
Aside from your own perspective, you can reach out to your guests for theirs. Ask them if they found the
meeting to be useful, from the length, to the information presented, to the way it was delivered. Depending on
the size of the attendance list, you can either ask individuals face-to-face or create and send out a survey over
email. This will provide you with helpful insight for future meetings as well as motivating employees to share
their feedback and engage in the process in an authentic way.

## Follow-up with an email summary


Get in the habit of sending a follow-up email within a day of the meeting. If the meeting is held at the end of the
day, you can send it out the next morning. If it’s held at the beginning of the day, you should shoot for sending
a follow-up that same day.
In this email, include an outline of the action plan once more along with other critical points mentioned during
the meeting that you want to reiterate. If you find it necessary, you can also send out minutes. And if there is
something you didn’t have time to address but don’t want to host another meeting for, you can throw it in your
email too. Lastly, use this as a time to remind people of their responsibilities and tasks related to the meeting.
The results of this final step are what will determine your overall ability to have effective meeting management.
