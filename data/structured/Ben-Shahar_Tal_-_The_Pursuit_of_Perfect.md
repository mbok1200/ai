message. Every person concerned with success—and that includes most of us—should read this book.” —Sonja Lyubomirsky, author of  Th e How of Happiness “ Th is book will inspire you to realize your innate

potential for happiness and awaken the genuine aspiration to change, while avoiding the trap of perfectionism and the unrealistic demands of the ego.” —Matthieu Ricard, author of  Happiness: A Guide to

Developing Life’s Most Important Skill “ Tal Ben-Shahar has done it again! In Happier, he invited us to rethink our assumptions about happiness and what it depends on. Now, in Th e Pursuit of Perfect, he invites us to discard the fallacy that the pursuit of

‘perfect’ is the best indicator of success and happiness.” —Nathaniel Branden, author of  Th e Six Pillars of Self-Esteem This page intentionally left blank TAL BEN-SHAHAR, Ph.D. How to Stop Chasing Perfection and

tually became the subject of my academic research. I started thinking about happiness as a successful but unhappy student, following several years as a successful but unhappy professional athlete. My desire to understand the cause of my unhappiness led

me into the then-emerging ﬁ eld of positive psychology. Unlike traditional psychology, which mostly focuses on neurosis, depres- sion, and anxiety, positive psychology focuses on the conditions that lead people, organizations, and communities to ﬂ ourish.

Simply put, positive psychology is the science of happiness. I beneﬁ ted a great deal from my studies of positive psychol- ogy and wanted to share what I had learned with others. I always knew, of course, that people were interested in the subject of hap-

piness, but I never expected interest on the scale that I encoun- tered when I began to write and lecture on how to lead a more meaningful and pleasurable life. In letters from readers, conversations with my undergraduate

students, and discussions in my seminars—whether with entrepre- x •● Preface neurs in Shanghai, political leaders in Canberra, at-risk teenagers in New York, journalists in Cape Town, or teachers in Paris—I

saw how passionately committed people were to improving their own lives and increasing the well-being of their communities. Over time, I began to see that all these diverse groups shared more than just an interest in leading happier lives—they also

shared some of the major obstacles to becoming happier. One of those obstacles, arguably the number one obstacle, is the aspira- tion to a life that is not just happier but perfect. Th is became apparent to me through two recurring, and some-

what surprising, reactions I encountered during conversations about happiness. First, people would often say that they weren’t happy; but as they described their lives and their feelings in greater detail, it became clear that what they really meant was that

they weren’t happy all the time. Second, people would comment that I myself didn’t seem to be bursting with joy as, they thought, a “happiness expert” ought to be at every moment. And when I would talk about my failures or my fears, they would express

surprise that I considered myself happy despite such undesirable experiences. Underlying both of these reactions is the assumption that truly happy people are somehow immune from feeling sad- ness, fear, and anxiety or from experiencing failures and setbacks

in life. Th e pervasiveness of this assumption—across generations, continents, and cultures—made me realize something astound- ing: I was surrounded by Perfectionists. I had for some time considered myself a recovering Perfection-

ist but had never before understood the phenomenon of perfec- tionism to be so pervasive. Many of the people I met and heard from, whom I recognized as fellow Perfectionists, may not have described themselves—or been seen by others—as such. Yet to

greater or lesser degrees their assumptions, their ways of thinking and being, were precisely those that deﬁ ne Perfectionists. More- Preface ●• xi over, they were all, in one way or another, suﬀ ering the harmful

consequences of perfectionism. Th is book is about what perfectionism really is and about how to overcome this obstacle to a happier life. Like my previous book, Happier, this book too was written as a

workbook. To beneﬁ t from it in a meaningful way, readers should not read straight through as if reading a novel. Instead, I sug- gest reading this book slowly, with stops and starts, taking time to apply the material and to reﬂ ect on it. To help you with this

process of action and reﬂ ection, there are exercises at the end of each chapter. Th roughout the book, there are also Time-Ins— questions or ideas to consider. Th ey provide an occasion to pause and reﬂ ect—and therefore to better understand and assimilate the

material. Th e exercises and Time-Ins can be done alone, in pairs, or in groups. Th e book can provide material for book clubs inter- ested in personal development, as well as for couples wishing to cultivate greater intimacy.

uted, directly or indirectly, to this book. Given the impossibil- ity of thanking every person to whom I am indebted, I will put into practice the ideas in this book and settle for something that is “good enough,” which unfortunately means leaving out many

names. My apologies and my gratitude to all of them. Kim Cooper, my dear friend and brilliant teacher, provided invaluable assistance on drafts of this book. Th roughout the process, she has helped me sharpen my thinking and hone my

writing. Katy Aisenberg’s insights found their way into the book—and into my life—with much grace and compassion. Zvia Sarel’s sup- port, emotionally and intellectually, has been immeasurable. My friends, colleagues, and students at the Interdisciplinary

Center in Herzliya, Israel, provided me the kind of work environ- ment that hitherto I had only read about. I am grateful to Idan Ofer for believing in me and for provid- ing me the opportunities to fail and learn. My appreciation to

and think and experience. My friends and colleagues Jan Elsner, Barbara Heilemann, and Amanda Horne further my thinking each time we meet. Adam Vital closely read and insightfully com- mented on the manuscript.

I have been fortunate to work with C. J. Lonoﬀ  from Speak- ing Matters and am grateful for her professionalism, and for truly caring. My deep gratitude to John Aherne and Ann Pryor from McGraw-Hill for their invaluable help and for making business

a pleasure. To Rafe Sagalyn, Bridget Wagner, Jennifer Graham Redd, and Shannon O’Neill from the Sagalyn Agency: what would I have done without you? No words can express my gratitude to my family—parents,
