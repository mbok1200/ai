Preface
This book is for businesses that aspire to superior business
agility, to deliver fit-for-purpose products and services, to delight
customers, and to provide the security of long-term survival
associated with mature businesses that consistently meet or
exceed customer expectations. Learn an lean approach by seeing
how Kanban made a difference in four real-world situations.
You'll explore how different teams used Kanban to make
paradigm-changing improvements in software development. These
teams were struggling with overwork, unclear priorities, and lack
of direction. As you discover what worked for them, you'll
understand how to make significant changes in real situations,
what are the key strategies to beat the Covid-19 pandemic and
for crisis management. You will also gain insight into how key
enablers help us build organizational resilience and enterprise
maturity model along with Portfolio/Upstream Kanban
implementations lessons learnt. Change is difficult. Even the US
government is going agile. Are you aware that "The brain
processes visual information 60,000 times faster than text"?
This Artefact has been developed as a resource to understand,
evaluate, and use agile and hybrid agile approaches. This
practice guide provides guidance on when, where, and how to
apply agile approaches and provides practical tools for

practitioners and organizations wanting to increase agility. It will
also help you in PMI-ACP and SAFe Exam preparation.
If you are a student, parent, graduate hire, tech developer, IT
consultant, Agile coach, Scrum master, product owner, leader,
manager, corporate change agents, CXOs, Sr. Manager, part of
product management team or IT operator / OPS, then this book
is perfect for you in order to increase profitability, effective ways
to handle different types of agile contracts, exceed productivity
goals, and elevate work culture through Agile KANBAN, XP,
FDD, DSDM, Scrumban and Scrum methodology.
This book is a single source, comprehensive action guide for
businesses and IT leaders and explains how to increase IT
delivery capabilities through the use of Agile and Kanban.
Factoring in constant change, communication, a sense of
urgency, clear and measurable goals, political realities, and
infrastructure needs, it covers all the key ingredients required for
success. Using real-world examples, this practical guide illustrates
how to implement Agile, Scrum, and Kanban in software and
non-software project management and development across the
entire IT and NON-IT departments. To make things easier for
busy students, parents, IT leaders and executives, this book is
an indispensable artefact.
This book promises to be a very good starting point for both,

beginners and experienced folk, and an asset for those having
insight towards agility. It also articulates how Agile is mapped to
traditional practices along with critical success factors of
adopting business agility.
Solving a client's issue may require many complex work streams, so
we set up a sprint. It's a way of getting people to be collaborative,
take accountability and feel empowered.

1.1 Implementing Agile for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs)
You might think that implementing Agile for Law Enforcement
Agencies is easy, but let me challenge that thinking. It's not
easy for a Product Owner implementing Agile for an
organization that deals with LEAs. I am a lead business analyst
for an IT firm, and we have a variety of products for India's
LEAs.
Because law enforcement agents are the smartest and the most
talented in our country, they are also the most difficult to tackle.
In most cases, the released working software after a sprint does
not meet their demands. Though we have the three pillars of
Scrum, namely and a fourth pillar — communication — is a
must for LEAs.
This article is not about the principles of Agile/Scrum and how
to apply them to LEAs; rather, it's about my six years of
experience working in this industry. To implement Agile for
LEAs, you must focus on the four common best practices, which
I believe are also the most important ones.

1.1.1 Agile best practices for LEA customers
Follow these best practices to facilitate your Agile
implementation for LEAs:
Be Being too vocal could skew stakeholders' perspectives.
However, a PO can't be too as that can consume more of the
stakeholders' time than necessary to elicit critical information.
These stakeholders are brief in everything they tackle and are
very precise too. A PO or a business analyst should be smart
enough to capture the most important user stories and quickly
but carefully prioritize them. And believe me, they won't tell you
everything, since they strongly believe in being self-taught.
Prioritize the In Scrum, we prioritize user stories for the sprint
that we believe is sprint-ready. However, the prioritized user
stories should again be prioritized if you want your sprints to
end without any user stories rolling into the next sprint. It
sounds obvious, but you need to be one step ahead than your
stakeholders. For instance, we have developed a method we
termed as sprint -1 before sprint 0, in which we release a small
feature that the stakeholders have requested. This may seem
uncommon compared to the cadence that we usually follow in
Scrum, but sprint -1 helped us significantly in a few of our

projects.
Avoid detailed Avoiding detailed documentation probably applies
more to a business analyst, because this individual is the one
who typically creates lengthy documents. But if you have
stakeholders for whom national security is their first priority,
avoid detailed documentation. They will not risk their time to
read those documents because the effort would add no value for
them, even if your document is worth reading. We used a
simple technique to counter this. We created PowerPoint
presentations of not more than 3–4 slides, and we used bullet
points for items that needed emphasis or attention. It saved us
time and increased our efficiency.
Improve Collaborating with stakeholders might be the most
challenging task for a PO, as these stakeholders will rarely be
available. You need to get to the right person at the right time,
for the right reason. We all accept the fact that this is the
worst part for us. Following are the reasons for project failure:
Improper/incomplete requirements gathering
Insufficient budget
Unavailability of the stakeholders

Collaboration will help overcome these issues. We carried out
the root cause analysis and discovered that some stakeholders
were not interested in participating in meetings because either
the project was not a concern or they were not willing to give
any information. The key here is to generate interest for them,
which is, again, one of the biggest challenges for a PO.
You can successfully implement Agile for LEAs if you can follow
the aforementioned best practices. Scrum is best suited for all
types of projects, as you release features every two to four
weeks. However, avoid four-week sprints when possible, because
they can introduce delays and change requests.

1.2 Agile methods adoption on software development – A pilot
review
Let's see some key pointers on it:
Motivation and Since the Agile Manifesto was published in 2001,
the number of organizations that have been trying to adopt agile
methods as a way to deal with software development has
increased. However, many of them have not reached their
adoption goals, which include fast and high-quality software
deliveries, software products that better satisfy users' needs and
flexibility to deal with scope changes throughout the project. The
results, on the other hand, are restricted to the adoption of few
practices, yielding low value to the developed software products
and also to people's potential on delivering them [1].
Assuming that an agile transformation is actually an
organizational change [2], companies have been trying to find
out from the existing ways to adopt agile methods one (or
more) that consider or exhibit similar organizational
characteristics as theirs [1]. In this context, many of the
published academic papers do not consider organizational
perspectives, presenting results from controlled environments or
specific projects and teams. From the studies that consider
agility as an organizational change, there are two distinct groups:

generic steps – independent from company context, and specific
steps (empiric) – related to an existing organization and its
transformation process.
No published study that proposed to evaluate the effective use
of generic adoption steps by the industry was found. Also, it is
not known if there is any guideline that can emerge from
specific (empiric) agile method adoption studies and can then
be used by other similar organizations. Our research aims to
investigate, by means of a systematic review, how organizations
adopt agile methods and, from those findings, aims to also
identify commons ways of empiric adoption based on the
characteristics of the analyzed organizations. We also want to
investigate if companies are considering generic ways of
adoption on their search for agility. This paper presents the
current state of the research and is declared as a pilot review. It
also follows the recommendations made by KITCHENHAM and
Charters, widely applied by systematic reviews on agile [3].
Performed systematic review protocol
Research question it possible to relate characteristics of
organizations to the steps they take to adopt agile methods We
also defined three secondary research questions needed to help
answer the main question:

What are the existing generic ways to guide organizational agile
adoption?
What were the main steps taken by organizations that adopted
agile methods empirically?
Is it possible to relate steps from empiric agile adoptions in
organizations to any of the existing generic ways?
Search Our search strategy included published studies from
electronic databases (searched by customizing the query below)
and also a complimentary hand search on the proceedings of
Agile and XP conferences.
Primary acceptance phase: A study was primarily accepted if its
title and its abstract (or conclusion) were related to
organizational adoption of agile methods, including
advantages/challenges, survey results and other perspectives. On
this phase, 3966 articles were rejected – among them we found
mostly irrelevant content from SpringerLink (due to restrictions
on the research query).
Brief qualitative We have already found some contributions for
our defined research questions by classifying the primary
approved studies and assessing five experience reports (Gap Inc.,

Amazon.com, Yahoo! Music, BabyCenter.com and Gale) and
assessing two frameworks for adoption (Agile Adoption
Framework and Agile Adoption Motivation Framework).
Existing frameworks and methods - There are at least 17 generic
ways that can be reused by organizations to help them adopt
agile methods. This number can increase during the quality
acceptance phase when studies will be assessed in detail. The
real number of existing frameworks or methods can be bigger
due to some articles that cover more than one of them.
Main steps taken by organizations - Scrum were selected by
Amazon.com [4], Yahoo! Music [5] and BabyCenter.com [6] as
the way to emerge agility, although they had different
motivations. All these adoptions started with a pilot-project or a
pilot-team and expanded to the entire organizations after
successful results were observed. The traditional culture of the
companies could be seen as their main motivation to move to
agility, expressed by a command-and-control management style at
Yahoo! Music [5], by the use of a waterfall model at Gap Inc.
[7] and Gale [8], and by the inability to deliver on the desired
pace by BabyCenter.com [6].
Relation between empiric and generic adoptions - Both assessed
frameworks considered the organizational perspective as a

restriction to the agile adoption. The Agile Adoption Framework
[9] proposes a go/no-go phase where the ability of the
organization to move towards agility is assessed by its real
necessity, its available budget and its executive support. This is
strictly connected to the agile adoption steps taken by Gale [8]
and BabyCenter.com [6], where the executive support was the
basis for the organizational changes needed.
Preliminary conclusions and next steps - There are consistent
contributions to answer the secondary research questions
provided by our brief qualitative analysis. The quality acceptance
phase, not yet concluded, will make it possible to gather the
data needed for the quantitative/qualitative analysis and the
discussion of the results, aiming to answer our main research
question. We believe the findings will be helpful for
organizations that want to move towards agility and want to be
guided from existing (and combined) experience from industry
and academia.

1.3 Agile metrics
What are metrics?
A metric is a system of measurement that includes: the item
being measured we measure), the method of measurement we
measure), and the inherent value associated with the metric we
measure, or what we intend to achieve by this measurement.)
"The most important things cannot be measured. The issues
that are most important, long term cannot be measured in
advance."
- W. Edwards Deming
Key purposes of using metrics
Control and feedback loop is driven by metrics. Once the ideal
state of the process is decided through analytics, it has to be
expressed in terms of metrics. This is because metrics are the
numbers that are being measured on a daily basis. Management
philosophy also believes that what is measured gets managed.
Hence, metrics suggest whether the process is in order or needs

external interference. They, therefore, form the basis of control in
any organization.
Following are the commonly used Agile metrics. They may vary
on a case to case basis.
The key element of building Agility is the mindset. To
understand the type of mindset shift expected from different
stakeholders, the following table can be useful:

Table 1.1: Agile metrics
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations. We've said that Agile is a mindset, not a specific
set of practices, and many Agile teams end up tailoring their
Agile methodology depending on their specific circumstances.

1.4 Applying Agile principles to our software insurance
implementation project
Though Agile was first implemented in the manufacturing
industry, today the Agile method has spread its wings over all
industries, including IT. We adopted the Agile method for one of
our core banking software implementation projects, and we
focused on the important Agile principles. This initiative proved
to be effective and started delivering good results right from the
beginning. The Agile method not only made the developers' and
functional anchors' work easier but also increased client
satisfaction.

1.4.1 Applying Agile principles to our insurance software
implementation project
Here is how we adopted Scrum against the backdrop of each
Agile principle.

1.4.1.1 Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through
early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
Let's see some key pointers on it:
The client was continually engaged in the development life cycle.
After sprint planning, developers first discussed the design with
the client and then started development. After developing each
component, developers showed the demo to the PO so that that
client was in agreement with what developers had coded before
releasing it for testing.
The team delivered the shippable product in each iteration. Our
commitment to the PO was always intact and all user stories
were completed on time.
We had 15-day sprints, so all the deliverables were done daily.
During sprint refinement, we ensured that business value was
attached to every user story. All user stories that did not have
any business value were rejected.
We've said that Agile is a mindset, not a specific set of
practices, and many Agile teams end up tailoring their Agile

methodology for their own circumstances.

1.4.1.2 Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive
advantage.
Let's see some key pointers on it:
The product backlog was prepared based on the refined
requirements. The PO analyzed the requirements before they
were translated into user stories. Therefore, the PO had a clear
vision with respect to the product backlog.
The team frequently discussed the development design with the
PO immediately after sprint planning. The purpose of this
activity was to involve the client in the development and make
the PO aware of the solution and the way we were developing a
user story. This way, the PO had no reason to raise any
surprise requirements during the sprint review meeting.
We accepted some changes in requirements or user stories from
the PO during a given sprint unless they impacted the timeline
and efforts. During the demo to the PO, our team also accepted
and developed some changes in requirements.
We maintained the product backlog in Jira and apart from this,
there were no other product backlogs.

The product backlog was reprioritized during refinement, and any
user story that was classified as a "must-have" and that had
business value was prioritized.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

1.4.1.3 Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of
weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter
timescale.
Let's see some key pointers on it:
The product increment was delivered to production daily. Stories
were delivered within 15-day sprints.
Automated scripts were used for testing. The automated testing
tool was used for testing all user stories.
The PO or customer was able to perform UAT on short notice.
After developing the user story, the tester ran a demo for the
PO and validated the development. The PO validated the
requirement or user story and tested various scenarios that he
felt were important.
We've said that Agile is a mindset, not a specific set of
practices, and many Agile teams end up tailoring their Agile
methodology for their own circumstances.

1.4.1.4 Business people and developers must work together daily
throughout the project.
Let's see some key pointers on it:
The PO was always available to validate the development of the
user story. The meeting with the PO was scheduled on a short
notice or as and when a developer was ready with the demo.
The PO and the team had a mutual commitment to the sprint
backlog.
The PO was always available to resolve our clarifications. If the
PO was not available, we raised an impediment in Jira with the
PO as the owner.
Functional/technical leads ran knowledge-sharing sessions for all
developers. These sessions contained both functional and
technical topics.
Additional backlog grooming sessions between POs and project
leads were planned one week before the start of the next sprint.
All the backlogs were prioritized based on discussions. Next, we
held a backlog refinement session with the Scrum team, who
worked on user stories.

In the backlog refinement sessions, the business prioritized the
backlog based on the business value, and this prioritization was
discussed with the Scrum teams.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

1.4.1.5 Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the
environment and support they need, and trust them to get the
job done.
Let's see some key pointers on it:
All user stories were allocated to the developers and testers
responsible for the stories.
The velocity of the team was understood, and user stories were
taken based on the velocity. The team was not overburdened
with user stories.
Developers and testers were also given proper guidance and
knowledge about the user stories, and solutions were clearly
explained to them.
The Scrum team members were involved in each discussion with
the PO, and their input on solutions was also considered. Team
members were motivated because their input was taken into
consideration.
All the impediments related to the applications and clarifications
from the PO were provided to the team on time. The timelines
of the clarifications helped the team to complete the

development and certification of user stories within the timebox.
A daily status with praises was sent to the entire team so that
the performing team members were motivated and honored in
the sprint retrospectives.
We've said that Agile is a mindset, not a specific set of
practices, and many Agile teams end up tailoring their Agile
methodology for their own circumstances.

1.4.1.6 Agile processes promote sustainable development. The
sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a
constant pace indefinitely.
Let's see some key pointers on it:
Awareness was created among all stakeholders about the sprint
goal and target user stories for each sprint.
All Scrum team members and the PO worked toward closing all
the user stories for a sprint.
Any pending clarifications from the bank were resolved based on
priority, so that development could continue.
The bank team was available to help the development team so
that user stories were closed on time.
We gathered feedback about the delivered product and evaluated
the collaboration between the Scrum team and the client. We
invited stakeholders to the review meeting/retrospective meeting
so that they could also participate in the discussions and
provide their feedback.

Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

1.4.1.7 Working software is the primary measure of progress.
Let's see some key pointers on it:
A user story was closed only when all the acceptance criteria
were met and the PO was satisfied with the development.
Any minor issue in development that was found during
certification resulted in the non-acceptance of the relevant user
story.
At every stage of development, a demo was shown to the PO
to ensure that the development met the bank's requirements.
After reviewing the user story during the sprint review, the PO
moved the user story to done.
We've said that Agile is a mindset, not a specific set of
practices, and many Agile teams end up tailoring their Agile
methodology for their own circumstances.

1.4.1.8 The most efficient and effective method of conveying
information to and within a development team is face-to-face
conversation.
Let's see some key pointers on it.
The functional anchor of the Scrum team were face-to-face
discussions with the development team regarding solutions for
user stories.
Any clarifications on a user story were discussed with the PO
and developers so that the developer had all the information.
The development team and functional teams sat in proximity to
each other so that any clarifications and discussions happened
around desks and not through emails.
After discussing with the development team and PO, all
clarifications or changes in user stories were updated in Jira
against the respective user story.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

1.4.1.9 Continuous attention to technical excellence and good
design enhances agility.
Let's see some key pointers on it.
After sprint planning, the developer discussed the technical
design of the user story with the bank's technical team to
ensure that the bank’s technical team understood the design.
The technical lead reviewed the code and added it as a task in
Jira. Unless this subtask was completed, the user story was not
moved to done.
Any defects in the code review were fixed in the same sprint,
which ensured a quality deliverable for the client.
Any technical impediments were resolved based on priority, and
importance was given to code quality.
A mechanism was built to continuously monitor the code during
the user story development.
Use it as applicable.

1.4.1.10 Simplicity — The art of minimizing the amount of work
not done is essential.
Let's see some key pointers on it:
The PO and the functional anchor viewed user stories that were
not completed.
User stories were measured based on the definition of
The amount of incomplete work was also measured based on
the non-completion of the subtasks defined for the user story.
If a user story was not completed because of pending
clarifications from the client, a technical defect, or change in
scope, an impediment was raised so that it could easily be
tracked for closure.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

1.4.1.11 The best architecture, requirements, and design emerge
from self–organizing teams.
Let's see some key pointers on it:
Team leads managed the Scrum team, which consisted of
developers, testers, and functional anchors.
The solution for any complex user story was arrived at by
conducting brainstorming sessions with all the Scrum team
members. Any ideas backed by developers, testers, and
functional anchors were analyzed and the best solution was
selected. These sessions allowed team members to come up
with creative and the best possible solutions, providing an
opportunity to enhance their skills.
The concept of a self-organized team was applied extensively; the
team never depended on outsiders for any solutions.
We've said that Agile is a mindset, not a specific set of
practices, and many Agile teams end up tailoring their Agile
methodology for their own circumstances.

1.4.1.2 At regular intervals, the team reflects how to become
more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
Let's see some key pointers on it:
Apart from the sprint retrospective, we had an internal
retrospective with all the team members from all the Scrum
teams. In this meeting, all the best practices, positive points,
and negative points were listed. From the list, some best
practices were selected for adoption and the most affecting
negative points were considered for improvement.
Team members shared best practices with the entire team so
that everyone could follow these practices.
Technical and functional knowledge transfer sessions were also
organized for all the team members to help people develop and
acquire new skills.

1.4.2 Conclusion
These best practices generated good results. 90% of the user
stories were completed in sprints — and in some sprints 100%
of the user stories — which bolstered the Scrum team's and the
client's confidence.

1.5 From non-IT standpoints, applying Agile principles in
industries across technologies
The most recent State of Scrum Report found that "Scrum and
Agile practices, once the sole domain of software developers, are
making significant inroads outside of IT and finding acceptance
in industries beyond technology."
The Agile mindset was recognized in 2001 at a summit of
practitioners who found consensus around core values captured
in 12 principles called the Agile
If you look at these two statements closely, you'll recognize a
problem. The Agile principles were thought of and built around
software development by software practitioners. Obviously, the
principles include many references to software or IT-specific
terminologies, such as early and continuous delivery of valuable
software, emergent architecture and technical design, and
working software as a principal measure of progress. People
from non-IT or the non-technology industry may find it difficult
to relate the principles directly to their work. We need generic
phrases that are applicable across industries and that simplify
the principles without losing their core essence.

The fact is that many Agile coaches, gurus, and practitioners
have already done this.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

1.5.1 Generalizing Agile principles
Culture follows values, practices follow the culture. Values must
always lead. Values are something that people think helps them
become better or more transparent.
Principle 1: Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
Emphasize customer Someone from outside the IT industry may
ignore the delivery of valuable software part. Instead, think of
something that is relevant to you or your industry. In reality, it
doesn't matter what the deliverable is (for example,= software, a
mechanical product, or a service). What matters is customer
satisfaction, which comes only after the return on investment.
So, the first principle of Agile is customer ROI.
Principle 2: Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's
competitive advantage.
How can you (your team, your process, or your solution)
welcome changes in requirements? By keeping your solution,

process, tool, service, or design changeable. Yes, the second
Agile principle is to be
Principle 3: Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of
weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter
timescale.
Again, you may ignore the working software part and emphasize
the delivered frequently aspect of this principle. It's all about
getting real, or as close as possible to a real-time response to
customer needs.
Principle 4: Business people and developers must work together
daily throughout the project.
The daily stand-up is the most popular and arguably the most
effective way to achieve cooperation. Your business context may
not allow you to hold these meetings, however. So, examine this
principle again, and think about what it aims to achieve. Yes,
it's all about clarity. The fourth principle is to bring more clarity
to everyone and everything. You may design your own way to
achieve that.
Principle 5: Build projects around motivated individuals. Give
them the environment and support they need, and trust them to

get the job done.
This principle is already A self-organizing team is the fifth
principle of Agile.
Principle 6: The most efficient and effective method of conveying
information to and within a development team is face-to-face
conversation.
Colocation may not work well for every industry. What does
work well is the investment in tools and bandwidth to create
virtually collocated teams and workspaces. Invest in these tools.
Principle 7: Working software is the primary measure of
progress.
In a non-IT business, working software is not part of your
model, so what is your principal measure of success? Focus on
the first and last part: working and measure of In this context, it
means Boolean done — something is either done (working) or
not done. The measure of success is not work-in-progress or
partial completion; nothing is successful if it's 40% or 80%
complete.
This is really interesting and important. None of your matrices

or MIS should be partially or a percentage complete. Design
your matrices with a Boolean-done approach to embrace the
seventh principle.
Principle 8: Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain
a constant pace indefinitely.
People are not a resource — they are people. If your team or
staff is working overtime, they will burn out soon; if they are
working too little, they will be bored. You must strike a balance;
understand people's needs and accordingly frame your work
rules and process. The eighth principle is about and it comes
from treating people as humans and not as a resource. (By the
way, who invented the awful term human
Principle 9: Continuous attention to technical excellence and
good design enhances agility.
Pay attention to continuous attention and ignore the technical
excellence and design part, if it is not applicable to your industry.
But don't confuse continuous attention for micromanagement or
continuous follow-ups. The ninth principle is about reviews and
continuous

Principle 10: Simplicity — the art of maximizing the amount of
work not done — is essential.
Nobel prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore said, is very simple
to be happy, but it is very difficult to be The tenth principle is in
the same vein — how to make things simple, be it process,
rules, tools, reporting, governance or operating model, or your
code and architecture (sorry for mentioning some IT stuff here).
Often people make things complicated by force of habit, by
trying to make something too perfect, or by overthinking.
Agile is all about simplicity.
Principle 11: The best architecture, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.
You may comfortably ignore architecture, requirements, etc., and
pay attention to emerge from self-organizing If you abide by the
above fifth principle (self-organizing team), all you need is
patience and belief; things will evolve into their best shape on
their own.
Principle 12: At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to
become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior
accordingly.

No point in guessing about this. It means to inspect and adapt
frequently. Frequency should be sustainable — neither too
frequent nor infrequent.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

1.5.2 Summary
Here is the alignment between each principle and its core
essence.
ROI (return on investment)
Changeable
Getting real/close-to-real time
Clarity
Self-organizing team
Collocation (virtually)
Boolean done
Sustainable pace

Continuous collaboration/review
Simplicity
Evolution
Frequent inspection and adaptation
As mentioned, this post is more of a compilation of common
thoughts presented by many Agile coaches and gurus, and some
original thoughts that may have been unintentionally overridden
by others. I apologize for any such cases.

1.6 Human resource management and Agility
Agility and human resource management are two practices that
you can combine to make your organization a better place to
work in. For example, a continuous improvement plan for an
employee can be depicted as an Agile element. Should an
organization wait a year before telling an employee that
something went wrong, or to ask what value-add he or she has
brought to the organization? No. We are wasting everyone's time
when we wait 12 months to review a problem. Instead, an
organization can include value stream mapping and an earned-
value analysis in a continuous improvement plan for each
employee.
Value stream mapping is a lean technique used to document,
analyze, and improve the flow of information or materials
required to produce a product or a service for a customer. In
this scenario, the organization is the customer. Earned-value
analysis is an industry-standard method of measuring a project's
progress at any given time, forecasting its completion date and
final cost, and analyzing variances in the schedule and budget
as the project proceeds.
I know that many Agilists object to using any metrics to chart

out an employee's progress. However, the reality is that many
(or most) organizations require some sort of basis for employee
evaluation. If this is the case, surely it is better to use an Agile
mindset and clear and transparent methods.
Every organization has monthly, quarterly, or annual goals.
Setting a long-term goal for an individual won't give a proper
return on investment, and long-term goals quickly become
irrelevant in a dynamically changing business environment. If an
organization can give their employees the opportunity to
participate in their monthly goals, then the organization and the
employees themselves can get quicker and clearer results. Every
organization can create avenues for their employees to have
such monthly goals.
Rather than having a monthly or an annual evaluation, then, it's
a better approach to have a review and a retrospective of goal
completion. This will create an open space for the management
and employee to discuss the obstacles, solutions, and
improvements to be worked on after the goal completion. If the
goal is yet to be accomplished by the time of this retrospective,
the management can guide and coach the employee. This will
build more trust and passion towards reaching targets, and over
time the organization can incubate high-performing knowledge
workers.

This is beneficial for the organization as well. Management will
learn how to coach and guide their employees in attaining
objectives rather than needing to micromanage. It's a win-win
situation.
So, what can be tracked? The coaching team or the
management team can track the time taken by their co-workers
to achieve their targets, and this should not be used as
performance measurement in any reviews. That would demoralize
employees and undermine their trust. But measurements such as
the time needed to reach goals, and the outcomes of those
achievements, are vital results for any organization trying to
make further improvements and come up with better coaching
or training plans. The results yielded from earned-value analysis
will help the organization draft better organizational goals in the
coming years and will also help in future hiring and searches
for ideal candidates.
The management team itself can come up with an earned-value
analysis chart for their overall or individual goal completion.
These need to be performed with a Lean coach, and it should
also be provided to the employee concerned upon his or her
request.
Also, give your employees the opportunity to perform
retrospectives with their managers about how the coaching and

guiding were handled and how effective it was. It's ideal to have
such an event just after a goal retrospective meeting. Make it
informal, go to a coffee shop, and grant employees the authority
to speak and express their ideas effectively. This way the
management will get direct feedback as well. This can ensure
transparency and eliminate organizational politics.
If you can make these things happen, then your organization
will indeed be a great place for employees to grow and build a
career at.

1.8 Kanban replenishment process with process orders and MRP
The Kanban method for controlling production and material flow
is based on the actual stock quantity in production. The
materials that are required on a regular basis is continually
provided in small quantities in production. Replenishment or the
production of a material is only triggered when a higher
production level actually requires the material. This replenishment
is triggered directly in production using previously maintained
master data. All other actions in the system are carried out
automatically in the background.
General script information
Primary module: Production planning
Description: Kanban replenishment using in-house production
through process orders.

Table 1.4: Master data required for Scenario
Purpose:
This demonstration script explains the business process of
replenishing Kanban for in-house production using process order.
The Kanban process is a proven lean manufacturing process that
can be very effectively employed in an in-house production
scenario. The business requirement for an in-house production
Kanban process is to replenish a fixed quantity of stock on an
as-needed basis by triggering a pull signal, which in turn creates
a production or process order.
The SAP Kanban process satisfies the business requirement of
quick and simple Kanban status change transactions to trigger
the creation or fulfillment of replenishment elements as
applicable. The steps in this script follow the procedure of
performing status changes of Kanban and executing the
transactions to process the replenishment element.

The steps in this document demonstrate the creation of a
process order as a replenishment element when status of the
Kanban is set to EMPTY The created process order is then
released. Goods are issued to the process order as per the bill
of material copied on the order.
The next step is to execute confirmations against the process
order as the operations and phases are performed. Based on the
routing of the material, either a manual goods receipt or an
automatic goods receipt transaction would be performed to
deliver the order.
The goods receipt for the process order will not set the Kanban
status to Instead the bin will show a sign indicating the goods
receipt has occurred, however the bin will stay The user will
then change the Kanban container status from EMPTY to FULL
once the goods are physically moved to the Kanban bin,
indicating the replenishment is complete. This demonstration
also displays the Stock Overview Transaction to view the
changes in the stock quantities before and after the
replenishment.
The demonstration also includes an optional step for changing
the Kanban bin status with a barcode scanner. Barcode numbers
can be printed for each Kanban container. In the Kanban
barcode number, the first 10 digits are the Kanban identification
number. The Kanban identification number is unique for each

bin and can be displayed by double-clicking on a bin in PK13N
transaction. The last digit identifies the status change. Value 0
changes to the next status, value 2 will change to EMPTY and
value 5 will change to Therefore, the business can choose to
have one barcode for setting to and another for setting to or
just one barcode that will set to the next status (from FULL to
EMPTY, or from EMPTY to

1.9 Kanban – In-house production
Replenishment strategies are maintained in IMG. It is assigned
to the material in the control cycle. It controls which process
such as in-house production or external procurement is to be
used for material replenishment or whether the required stock
transfer between storage locations will happen.
There are three types of replenishment strategy:
Replenishment strategies for in-house production. Here,
production of the Kanban quantity happens in-house, to supply
other production.
Replenishment strategies for external procurement. Here, the
Kanban quantity is obtained using an order or a scheduling
agreement from a vendor.
Replenishment strategies for stock transfer. Here, you transfer
the Kanban quantity to supply your own production.

1.9.1 Introduction to the Kanban concept
Culture follows values, practices follow the culture. Values must
always lead. Values are something that people think helps them
become better or more transparent.
The material flow in Kanban is organized by the cards that are
fitted in each container containing one material with a fixed
quantity.
As soon as the container is emptied at the demand source the
replenishment is initiated.
The supply sources can be in another place and it can be in-
house production, an external supplier or a warehouse.
The demand source will use another full container until the
previously emptied container is re-filled.

principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

1.9.2 Kanban card
Let's see some important pointers on it:
The Kanban card is made available for each container. Generally,
these cards will be pasted in the container with the details of
the material, qty, production line, etc.
These cards can also be made available with barcodes which
help to scan and trigger the signals for the subsequent function
(EMPTY or FULL).

Culture follows values, practices follow the culture. Values must
always lead. Values are something that people think helps them
become better or more transparent.

1.9.3 Push principle/Pull principle comparison.
Kanban works on a which means materials are called from the
supply source by to rather than to
When a container is empty then the Kanban signal is created

Kanban – Pull/Push principle
Let's depict some important pointers on it:

Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

1.9.4 Advantages of Kanban
The following are the advantages of Kanban:
It is a simplified form of production control.
Manual posting effort is minimized.
Material is not produced in advance (JIT).
Culture follows values, practices follow the culture. Values must
always lead. Values are something that people think helps them
become better or more transparent.

1.9.5 Kanban in SAP
Let's see some important pointers on it:
In SAP, we can map the complete flow of the Kanban.
Here the signals for FULL and EMPTY can be triggered by
status changes.
SAP offers three different replenishment strategies for the
Kanban:
In-house production
External procurement
Stock transfer
Each of these replenishment strategies has defined functions and
can be configured with many sub-strategies, which means that in
the in-house strategy we can have with REM, with production
order, etc.

Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

1.9.6 Master data for Kanban
Based on the type of replenishment strategy the set of master
data needs to be setup. But below are the master data that
needs to be setup in common.
Kanban control cycle
Supply area
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

1.9.7 Kanban – With in-house production
The following steps will help to setup a Kanban cycle for in-
house production with a REM cycle.

1.9.8 Master data
Let's see some important pointers on it:
Material master
BOM
Rate routing
Production version
Product cost collector
Production supply area
Kanban control cycle
Assuming that the 1 to 5 master data is already available we will
continue to work on the steps for the remaining master data.

1.9.9 Production supply area setup (PK05)
Let's see some important pointers on it:
All the Kanban control cycles are created specific to the material
+ supply area combination.
So, production supply area is one of the important master data.
It is an interim storage location on the shop floor which is
used to provide material directly to the production line or the
work center.
It is customized with Plant/S. Location/Person responsible.
Goods movements are posted to the storage location assigned
to the supply area.
One storage location can be assigned to several supply areas;
however, one supply area cannot be assigned to several storage
locations.

Let's depict some important pointers on it:

1.9.10 Kanban – Control cycle creation
The control cycle defines the relationship between the demand
source and the supply source. The control cycle contains the
following control data for Kanban production:
Kanban circulation, that is, the number of Kanban and the
Kanban quantity.
The basic data required for automatic Kanban calculation, if
necessary.
Replenishment strategy.
Printing Kanban, if necessary.
The delivery address, if necessary.
The process control (for example, an indicator for separate
goods receipt, status sequence key, an indicator for the logic for
triggering replenishment for ' make quotes straight throughout the
book Kanban), if necessary.

1.9.12 Kanban status changes
Let's see some important pointers on it:
The progress of production in Kanban is controlled by setting
the Kanban to the appropriate status.
By changing the status, both the demand and the supply source
are also guaranteed an up-to-date overview of production
progress in the Kanban board. Usually, only the two statuses,
EMPTY and FULL are used.
If the material in a Kanban is used and a Kanban is then set to
then replenishment is automatically triggered with this Kanban
status, i.e. the supply source receives the signal to re-fill the
Kanban.
When the Kanban is returned, full, to the demand source, it is
then set to status FULL and goods receipt is posted for the
material.
As a rule, Kanban is possible with both statuses EMPTY and
and the status changes are made using a bar code and a bar

code scanner.
The system automatically sends all important information from
the demand source to the supply source simply by scanning the
bar code.

1.10 Distributed Agile Kanban implementation in a large
multinational aviation organization – A case study
Client
The client is Europe's second-largest aviation organization (in
terms of passengers carried) having presence across the world
with annual revenue of US$41.1 billion for the fiscal year 2018.
The challenges
Here, the AMS support team is working for supporting more
than 80+ applications in different geographies. The customers
need the support team to deliver different results every day
according to the schedule of their applications continuously. The
common Agile practice Scrum is not very appropriate for such a
team to use. The team faced re-work, delay and task conflict
etc. problems. The team would like to improve itself.
Some of the customers did not determine the requirements and
the deployment date, but the support team members were
assigned tasks and did not know the priority and completed the
work too early. The work results waited for the customer to
confirm. When the customer changed the requirements, it

required the team member to re-work.
Because the tasks were totally assigned to the members by the
team leader, each team member had many tasks in his/her
hand. They were not able to deal with which one should be
completed first. It caused some urgent tasks to be delayed.
Task Because of lack of communication, the team members did
not know what other members were doing. Different team
members worked for the same application. And their deliverable
was in conflict.
The solution
Here, the support team implemented Kanban practice. What they
did:
Analyzed the value stream mapping and simplified the workflow
and set up visible Kanban wall.
Limited the amount of work-in-progress
Changed from assigning tasks to pulling tasks.

Set up several types of Agile meetings for improving the team
continuously.
The opportunity statement
The team receives, on an average, nine process tickets from the
clients every day. Originally it needs an average of 25 business
days lead time for solving one ticket. Every team member needs
to spend four hours per work week to re-work for their finished
tickets. With the Agile Kanban practice, the team increased its
efficiency in solving tickets. Meantime, the team improved the
quality of the deliverables to reduce the re-work rate. The team
also ensured the just-in-time delivery process.

1.10.1 Kanban deployment framework
Culture follows values, practices follow the culture. Values must
always lead. Values are something that people think helps them
become better or more transparent.
Step 1:
- An approach to design Kanban
Show your lanes
Agree metrics and baseline
Map your value chain(s)
Aim simple design
Target WIP
Hook your hurdles

Leverage governance to measure benefits
Step 2:
Now,
Run Kanban hurdles using a physical wall for 1-4 weeks
Set-up dashboard to review WIP board and key metrics
Run retrospective meetings - Weekly/Fortnightly (internally)
Report Kanban disruptions
Set-up digital wall and video conference facilities.
Step 3:
Now,
Conduct tool training

Adopt digital wall
Identify blockers

principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

1.10.2 Why adopt Kanban - Daily management system?
Let's depict some important pointers on it:
The brain processes visual information 60,000 times faster than
text.
It ensures the work is done in the right way and at the right
time, in order to achieve business success according to
objectives set by the organization.
Allows people at all levels of the organization to clearly visualize
whether the performance is good or bad on any given day (if
necessary, even hourly, weekly, or monthly).
It helps to rapidly identify any deviation from the target, which
makes everybody involved in the process equally responsible for
taking the necessary actions to quickly correct the problem and
restore the expected level of performance.

1.10.3 The Kanban board
Let's see some important pointers on it:
The display clearly shows the flow of work through the process/
At a glance, we can see the size of the backlog and how much
work is in progress.
An increase in backlog, or work-in-progress would be highlighted
Online tools recommended – Jira.

Kanban board – Expedite lane
Let's depict some important pointers on it:
Figure 1.50: Kanban board – Expedite lane
Following are the general practices of Kanban:

Visualize (with a Kanban board Make invisible work and
workflows visible. Understand and focus on your customers'
needs and expectations.
Limit work-in-progress (with Kanban Control and limit WIP limit
based on the volume of work items (Incident, SR, CR).
Manage flow
Make policies Manage the work, let people self-organize around
it, start working on pull rather than and reduce multitasking.
Implement feedback Evolve your management policies to improve
customer and business outcomes, put the focus on first time
right quality.
Improve collaboratively, evolve Gain agreement to pursue
improvement through evolutionary change (using models and the
scientific method).

1.10.4 Kanban in mainframe, Java, testing and data-stage
applications
The BAU application delivery was identified as an ideal candidate
area for implementing Kanban in view of the business criticality
of the application and the volume of incidents, problem records,
service requests, and minor enhancements involved.
The operational environment displays a high degree of variability
in priority and is ideal for Kanban. The challenge of distributed
geographies is expected to be mitigated with the use of an
online tool like MURAL/Jira.
WebEx/Skype was used at the offshore ODC to conduct huddle
meetings. The onshore team and client used video conferencing
in order to join the meeting.

1.10.5 The journey so far
Let's discuss some important pointers on it.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.
We've said that Agile is a mindset, not a specific set of
practices, and many Agile teams end up tailoring their Agile
methodology for their own circumstances.
The key element of building Agility is the mindset. To
understand the type of mindset shift expected from different
stakeholders, the following table can be useful:

1.10.7 Kanban daily mantra
Let's see some key pointers on it:
Is the board up-to-date?
Always keep the dashboard updated. In Kanban, the dashboard
should reflect the correct and updated state of activities at any
point of time.
Are you respecting WIP limits?
The team always maintain a smaller number of activity in WIP
(3-4 max) for a 5/6 people team. The team concentrates more
in getting an activity done faster than doing more activities.
Are you showing blockers and working to remove them?
Always treat blockers with higher priority. Remember that it is
interrupting the momentum and eating up your velocity. Have
daily calls with the stakeholders to remove the blockers if
necessary.

Do you know which task you should be working on and what is
next?
Always be aware of the next tasks that clients want to get done.
It gives you some time to prepare and highlight the concerns
up-front. Be updated about your list.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

1.10.8 Kanban explicit policies implemented
Let's see some key pointers on it.
Make policies explicit - Manage the work, let people self-organize
around it, start working on pull rather than and reduce
multitasking.
Explicit policies for done:
Please tailor it for LH.COM AMS project as you are using Jira
tool.
Sample example from LH ADC AMS team:
When the status of any particular HPALM defect has been to
Testing / DAT it will be considered as from the IBM AMS team
members’ side.
When status of any particular work item in RTC has been
changed to it will be considered as from the IBM AMS team
members’ side.

Explicit policies for blocker:
In case any long pending blocker (risk or issue) is present in
the Kanban board which needs management/main stake holder's
attention, please capture it in project-level risk and issue the
tracker for necessary attention.
Explicit policies for "doing":
Consultant needs to focus on instead of to in order to limit
WIP with Kanban. Any consultant (say, A) will not work on
more than two WIP at a time.
Are you respecting WIP limits?
The team always maintains a smaller number of activities in
WIP (3-4 max) for a 5/6 people team. The team concentrates
more in getting the activity done faster than doing more
activities. In case of more resource count, increase the WIP with
Kanban.
FYI:

Compare the speed of small batch size vs. large batch size:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoLHKSE8sfU
"Why Limiting Work in Progress Makes Sense" by David Lowe,
KCP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W92wG-HW8gg
Urgent work or emergency work item (say, P1 incident, legal
change, etc.) can have its own swim lane. Everyone works
together to get the urgent work done.
Discourage multitasking and focus on delivering time to the
customer of any deliverable.
Multitasking reduces efficiency by up to 40%.
Explicit Policies for "to do" :
Avoid keeping HPALM defects and RTC work items on Kanban
board under having duplicates or irrelevant (not in IBM scope),
reduce waste.

1.10.9 Kanban key benefits
Let's see some key pointers on it:
The productivity increased. The average lead time of a task
reduced from 25 days to 10 days.
The team had more communication and less task conflict.
The team had fewer delays so the customer was more satisfied
with the results.
The team had less re-work so that it saved human cost to $
value19,000 per month in 2017.
The team members were happier and more proactive to work in
the team.

Kanban benefits – Average lead time per month
Cycle time is measured from when work starts until it is ready
to be delivered, but it may refer to customer lead time, or (very
differently) to the reciprocal of delivery rate. Customer lead time
is the time work items take to go through the system—as
experienced by the customer. Typically, this is measured from
request creation to delivery/ticket resolution.
Try to measure your finish date and start date and lead time.
Try to see where the maximum delay is happening in the
system and why:

Figure 1.54: Kanban benefits – Average lead time per month
The average lead time is reduced from 30 to the lowest in less
than 10 days:
Lead time means the average total date from when a task was
created by a customer to when the task is closed. From this
diagram, we can see that the lead time decreased since May
after the team adopted Agile.

Kanban benefits – Spectral analysis
Let's depict some important pointers on it:
Figure 1.55: Kanban benefits – Spectral analysis
Most of the SR/PR/CR tickets can be solved within 5 -10 days.
This diagram is for analyzing why some of the tasks spent very
long or short time to solve. It clearly demonstrates how long is

normal for solving a task.

Completed CR/PRs
Let's depict some important pointers on it:
Figure 1.56: Completed CR/PRs
The work-in-progress in this year did not fluctuate wildly.
Kanban drives members to take ownership to pull tasks instead
of assigning tasks by the leader. It reduces lead time and

increases productivity.

Kanban – Wait time and activity time
Let's depict some important pointers on it:
Figure 1.57: Kanban – Wait time and activity time Source:
leankanban.com)
Total Cycle Time (TCT)
TCT = 40 + 60 + 130 + 120 + 120+ 30 + 540 + 10 = 1200
Min
Activity Time (AT)
AT = 120+ 30 + 540 + 10 = 700 Min

Process Efficiency (PE)
PE % = AT / TCT
PE % = 700 / 1200 * 100 = 58%

Kanban – Cumulative flow diagram
Let's depict some important pointers on it:
The Cumulative Flow Diagram was introduced by Lean thought
leaders, Don Reinertsen and David
CFD is an important tool for tracking and forecasting Agile
projects.
It shows work in different states: Total scope, in-Progress, and
completed.
The report provides insight into the burnup chart, cycle time,
work-in-progress, and bottlenecks in one place.
With this information, the Scrum master can focus on the areas
requiring attention, and thus improve the team's throughput.
To compare arriving requests with the completed work, use
CFDs, which map arrival rate onto closure rate data. The
gradient of the area describes your velocity over time while the

space between this line and the line may be defined as WIP. If
the width, of a part of the WIP area, increases, it could be a
sign that a bottleneck is occurring.
If the gradient of the area is steeper than the gradient of the
area it is a clear sign that you are adding more work to your
system than your current capacity. Projecting where the gradients
of and cross is your current best guess for a final release date.
Average cycle time and quantity in queue can also be
established from the diagram.
Here's how it works. Every day, count how many items are in
each column. Then visualize it in a CFD like this:

Figure 1.58: Kanban – Cumulative flow diagram Source:
leankanban.com)
CFD helps determine the amount of inventory in the system.
Little's law states that at a given WIP level, the ratio of Work-In-
Progress to Cycle Time equals throughput (T). CFD is defined as
a stacked line chart that shows the delivery rate and work-in-
progress for multiple states or activities
Metric

Key challenges
Let's see some key pointers on it:

Skills gap
Newer ways of working require augmented skills.
Funding
Budgets are often carved out from wider portfolios and
initiatives than specifically funded.
General e.g.
We thought paying you was to run it the best way. Now don't
say it was always run the crappy way.
So where is the business case, what's the ROI, and when is the
break-even?
When can we see this implemented with all the so-called
benefits?
We don't have a budget for this, period.
Maturity level

This needs to be managed in a realistic way by continuously
assessing agile readiness and maturity levels.
Culture
Culture drives behavior, and behavior drives results. For example
Let's wait for the right time to get started.
Oh yeah, we will do this next year.
Honestly, this won't work here.
Change Management, For example We are doing just fine, thank
you.
Oh, this sounds great, but actually, we don't need really need it.

1.11 Scrum implementation in a large multinational tobacco
organization – A case study

Introduction
MSP proactively participated in setting up of SAP-based
application enhancement services through Scrum methodology for
a client in a cost-effective manner offshore Agile delivery model
helped them to create a change management process for
managing Minor Requests For Change

Client overview
The client is one of the world's largest tobacco organizations
having presence across the world with annual revenue of
US$78.098 billion for the fiscal year 2017.
In this project, multiple instances of legacy systems were
replaced by a single instance SAP solution. The new system is
being used across Asia, Europe, and America, and therefore
requires extensive support.

Scrum monitoring
Let's depict some key pointers on it:
Figure 1.61: Scrum monitoring
Typically, burndown charts show either the estimated time
remaining, as shown here, or estimated story points remaining.
(A story point is basically a unit of work that has been defined
by the team).

Scrum monitoring tools/burndown chart
Let's see some important pointers on it.
We've seen that agile teams rely on low-tech, high-touch tools
displayed on highly visible information radiators, and burn charts
are one of the most common tools displayed in this way. Burn
charts are important because they make the team's progress
visible at a glance and make it easy to forecast when the
project (or a release within the project) will be complete.
There are two kinds of burn charts, burndown and burnup.
Burndown charts show the estimated effort remaining on the
project, and burnup charts show the features that have been
delivered already.

Figure 1.62: Scrum monitoring – Burndown chart
A burndown chart tracks the work that remains to be done on a
project. As work is completed, the progress line on the chart
will move downward, reflecting the smaller amount of work that
still needs to be done. The most common use of burndown
charts is for measuring the team's progress in completing the
project work.

High-level scrum process
Let's depict some important pointers on it:
Figure 1.63: High-level Scrum process
Scrum is a process framework for new product development
created by Jeff Sutherland and Ken The word is taken from the
rugby game where the team huddle is called scrum. Since new
product development is very complex, Scrum offers an iterative

and incremental development approach. In Scrum, there are
three roles namely, Scrum master, product owner and
development team of size 3 to 9. All three roles are empowered
to do their job and have no authority over each other. However,
they work as self-organizing teams to deliver a product with
complimenting skills.

Conceptual model
The conceptual model is constructed based on the product
owner competences (derived from literature and the interviews),
the indicators for stakeholder satisfaction and the criteria for
team effectiveness respectively, as discussed above. Based on
this model the relation of each of the competencies to the
stakeholder satisfaction and team effectiveness is tested.
Let's depict some important pointers on it:

1.12 Difference between Kanban and MRP
Let's see some important pointers on it:
In MRP procedures, production quantity and dates are calculated
in accordance with PIR and explosion of BOM.
The material is pushed through production on the basis of these
dates which is called push principle.
In Kanban techniques, no separate, higher-level planning is used
to control the material flow through production. Instead, the
work center further down the line, which is called demand
source, requests material from the preceding work center (supply
source) only when it is required, which is called pull principle.
When the material quantity of a Kanban has been consumed, it
is given the status EMPTY and is sent to the supply source.
The Kanban is the signal for the supply source to go ahead and
produce the quantity of material recorded on the Kanban.
Once production is complete, the material is delivered to the
demand source which confirms the receipt of the material by

setting the status back to FULL.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

1.13 Kanban procedure
Let's see some important pointers on it:

1.13.1 Classic Kanban
Let's see some important pointers on it:
In the classic Kanban production control method, the demand
source, the supply source and the procedure to be used to
replenish the material are defined in the control cycle as well as
the number of Kanbans that circulate between the supply source
and the demand source and the quantity per Kanban.
In this classic Kanban procedure, the Kanban signal always only
triggers replenishment for the Kanban quantity defined in the
control cycle. Moreover, it is not possible to circulate more
Kanbans than are defined in the control cycle without changing
the control cycle first.

Replenishment Strategies are maintained in IMG. It is assigned
to material in control cycle. It is assigned to the material in the
control cycle. It controls which process such as in-house
production or external procurement is to be used for material
replenishment or whether the required stock transfer between
storage locations will happen.
There are three (3) types of replenishment strategies:
Replenishment strategies for in-house production
Here, production of the Kanban quantity happens in-house, to
supply other production.
Replenishment strategies for external procurement
Here, the Kanban quantity is obtained using an order or a
scheduling agreement from a vendor.
Replenishment strategies for stock transfer

Here, you transfer the Kanban quantity to supply your own
production.

Agile maturity dashboard
Things to note before you start using this playbook:
This is a self-assessment tool provided for teams to baseline
their maturity with the implementation of their Agile practices.
The goal is not to get a maximum score but to identify the
practices that need more attention, and areas that can be built
upon.
Use this playbook to baseline your current practices, identify and
implement the improvements, and repeat!
It is strongly recommended that you use an Agile coach to
conduct you first assessment - there are some terms and
practices that need to be explained to be fully understood.
It is also strongly recommended for this assessment to be
conducted involving all team members (including any client
representatives that may also be part of the team).

Agile maturity

We must strive to create an organization of maturity Level 4 at
least.

Organizational maturity levels
ML 0. Oblivious
The organization is oblivious to the need for the process.
Individuals complete tasks with little team collaboration. There
are basic personal Kanban boards evolving to an awareness of
too much work-in-progress.
ML 1. Emerging
Process definition is emerging but may be applied inconsistently.
There is a concept of team and collaboration but poor
alignment. May have a basic team Kanban board or a board
with tasks separated by team members.
ML 3. Managed
Processes, workflows and policies are understood and consistent.
Service definitions and agreements are clear and defined. A
Kanban pull system is in place. Desired outcomes are achieved
consistently. Service delivery is fit-for-purpose. Customers are
satisfied.

ML 4. Managed quantitatively
There is a use of metrics and sophisticated feedback loops.
Actively managed classes of services and shared resources.
Capacity is deliberately allocated and adjusted intentionally.
Consistent economic outcomes. Stakeholders are satisfied.
ML 5. Optimizing
Optimized for efficiency and improved economic outcome. A
culture of continuous improvement emerges. Use of quantitative
analysis, feedback loops, experiments, and model-driven
improvements.
ML 6. Congruent
Can continually align strategy to operational capabilities. Robust
to market shifts. Beyond adaptive, capable of reinvention. is Anti-
fragile.

Scrum-ban is a great solution for teams who need the structure
of Scrum with the flexibility of a flow-based method.
It can be used for teams who are looking to transition from
Scrum to Kanban.
It can be used as a transition point between a less mature and
more mature Agile practice.
Here, work-in-progress (WIP) limits are not present.
What is the frequency to submit Scrum-ban metrics "cycle time"
in the AMS Project?
Useful at "ready queue in Scrum-ban".

Select the correct answer(s).
Monthly
Weekly

The faster your cycle time, the quicker you can introduce new
features to your end-users.
It is to track their performance in terms of the number of cards
that reach the done column within a set period of time.
Tracking these metrics on a regular frequency will provide teams
with the ability to ensure that the improvements or changes they
are making are creating the right outcomes.
Tracking both the throughput and cycle time for a team on a
monthly basis will help see the trends for that team. If the
average goes up, then let's keep doing what we are doing. If it
goes down, then let's stop doing whatever we introduced, or
figure out what has changed in that period of time.

Being able to provide your business owners some kind of idea
when the features will be completed helps to manage
expectations and avoid unpleasant surprises later on.
In Scrum-ban, "average cycle time" is getting calculated as____.
Select the correct answer.
Average cycle time = Avg. work-in-progress / Avg. throughput
Average cycle time = Avg. work-in-progress - Avg. throughput
Average cycle time = Avg. work-in-progress + Avg. throughput
Average cycle time = Avg. work-in-progress * Avg. throughput
Average cycle time = Avg. work-in-progress ^ Avg. throughput
Which of the following is true about "cycle time" in Scrum-ban?
Select the correct answer(s).

If the WIP goes down, then the cycle time goes down as well.
If the WIP goes down, then the cycle time increases.
If the "avg. throughput" goes down, then the cycle time
increases.
If the "avg. throughput" goes down, then the cycle time goes
down as well.
If the "avg. throughput" increases, then the cycle time goes
down.
Which of the following are true about in Scrum-ban?
Scrum-ban metric is cycle time.
Scrum-ban metric is velocity.
It's a Scrum/Kanban hybrid process framework.
It is useful in complex systems like the software development
process.
Scrum master is mandatory.

What performance metrics are mandatory for AMS Project(s)
following Scrum-ban?
Select the correct answer(s).
Defect detection efficiency.
Burndown, velocity.
Cumulative flow diagram, lead time cycle time.
Defect rejection rate.
Average cycle time.
What are the "planning routines" in Scrum-ban?
Select the correct answer(s).
Planning on demand for new tasks.
Sprint planning.

Release/iteration planning, demand planning.
Story planning.
Just-in-time (decisions and facts just when they are needed)
tickets.
Which of the following are not disadvantages of Scrum-ban?
Outdated Scrum-ban board can cause issues.
Hard to track individual team member effort and contribution
where they are shared resources.
Can't use for large projects.
Scrum-ban brings equality and less stress in the team.
Can't use for complex systems.

3.1 Corporate culture in failed Agile transformations
Much has been written on how Scrum works and how to make
it succeed. But there are few talks about why it fails. It doesn't
fail because of any inherent processes in Scrum itself; it
primarily fails because people incorrectly implement it by
committing a sin (Scrum in name). I have worked with several
teams who underwent the Agile transformation by adopting the
Scrum framework, and I have had a chance to talk to colleagues
and friends from other organizations about their experiences.
One thing that is common among transformation failures is the
of an Agile

3.1.1 C-level management
In most cases in traditional top-down organizations, when a C-
level executive initiates the Agile transformation across the
organization, business unit, or line of business, it cascades
down the corporate ladder to the root-level development and
operation teams. When such organizations are in the process of
becoming Agile, the transformation is mainly driven by the
management, because they are inherently top-down in nature.
Here's where mid-level management plays a crucial role. Success
or failure during Agile adaptation in large organizations is
primarily attributed to the employees in those mid-level
management roles.

3.1.2 A comparison of middle-management types
Based on my observations and discussions, mid-level managers
fall into two categories in such large organizations. Category one
includes managers (actually leaders) with a penchant for
technology and agility (as in having the Agile mindset for
adapting to change). They envision eventual success and aid
their teams in becoming truly Agile. Category two includes
managers who are non-adaptive to change and are either non-
technical (sometimes pretending to be technical) or purely
resource managers. The Agile adaptation is challenging because
they need to break out of their comfort zone and eventually
expose what they know and what they do in their role. In my
experience, here is how these two types react to different
challenges that come with an Agile transformation.
The Agile framework creates transparency, which is a critical
success factor, especially for category two people. For category
one people, transparency is an implicit, day-to-day reality.
Category one managers promote the self-organizing team culture,
whereas category two managers try to drive things on their own,
with Agile in name only.

Category one grants more power to the team and addresses
their impediments. Category two most often becomes the
impediment to the team's growth.
Scrum master Category one types can step into the Scrum
master's shoes with the proper mindset of not having the team
report to him or her and acting as a true servant-leader.
Category two types remain managers in Agile (an oxymoron).
Story-point Category one individuals encourage teams to provide
estimates in story points by using tools such as Planning
Poker.® Category two individuals provide estimates in days and
on their own, without minimal or no input from the team.
Stakeholder Category one brings the teams and stakeholders
together and keeps them on the same page all the time,
whereas category two prefers to deal with stakeholders on their
own behind closed doors, keeping them aloof from the team.
Category one follows an open-door policy and moves flexibly to
different teams, assuming new roles as needed. Category two
prefers to stay in the comfort zone and many times feels
insecure. I heard of an example in which a category two person
was forced to take part in a Planning Poker activity, and he

ended up copying the estimate from a fellow team member.
My intent is not to disparage or criticize category two
individuals. They can be a valuable asset for the organization —
with the proper change in mindset. They may need support to
become more adaptive to change. If they cannot, there are many
other roles in which organizations can make use of their
services. The success or failure of Agile in the organization
depends on how soon such individuals are identified and
eventually transformed or moved into other roles that are right
for them. Continuing as a category two manager in Agile teams
makes the whole team dive into a downward spiral and become
overworked, confused, frustrated, and dissatisfied.
Simply doing Agile is not correct; one should become Agile. This
happens only with a change in the organizational culture and
each individual's mindset.

3.2 How to facilitate organizational transformation
Any transformation should be a journey, not a destination. Based
on my experience, here are the steps that I would follow for any
organizational transformation to Agile.

3.2.1 Raise awareness about the need for improvement
The first step is self-realization. This is not new technology or a
new fashion trend that you can follow and embrace. Instead, it
is a transformation of the way we work. Have you ever
considered why we do not have the time to improve, but we
have plenty of time to do the same work inefficiently and
resolve the same problems again and again? If the organization
is not aware of its shortcomings, no transformation will work.
Being self-aware helps us to understand the habits of working
and prepares the basics of working to improve cost, time,
scope, team relationships, and individual morale. Raise
awareness around the transformation work in every department
of the organization.
Create a feedback box at the entry of your reception area or
cafeteria, and ask for suggestions from everyone on
improvements they want to see. You can do an anonymous
survey to reach a bigger audience. Refrain from doing any audit
on the existing ways of working.
Analyze the findings and prepare a to-be state that you want. I
have noticed that in the name of competition, we embrace
something that is at odds with our organizational culture and

vision and then blame it on the failure of the transformation
coach or team. I am not going to advocate for any specific role
but want to inform that transformation is a collective activity.
We all succeed and fail as a team. If anything is to be blamed,
then it will be our inability to improve.

3.2.2 Set a goal for value creation
We as humans always need a goal to pursue. Without a goal
we will withdraw before the end. Read the story of Florence
Chadwick in Near and Yet So Broaden your imagination, and go
to the future and look at the need to achieve. An organizational
transformation depends on each department coming forth and
being part of the journey. If you go to the gym, each part of
your body has to undergo a transformation or else your figure
will be flawed.
Give shape to your vision. Do not try to boil an ocean to define
a vision statement and set the related objectives. Keep a short-
term goal and a long-term goal. Verify that the objectives should
be achievable in an iterative and incremental way. Do not be
rigid by having quantifiable objectives only. Look at the softer
aspects of the transformation that cannot be measured in the
short-term but will have a long-lasting effect for a generation to
reap.

3.2.3 Implement the transformation for value realization
You can follow any implementation process that you like and are
comfortable with. My suggestion will be to always make the
transformation in an iterative and incremental way. Involve all
the stakeholders. Create a top-down approach instead of a
bottom-heavy approach. People want to follow leaders who are
role models. By doing only a command-and-control approach, we
will have an effect in the short term but experience long-term
resentment. Make them part of the transformation rather than
make the transformation for them. Prepare people to embrace
the new ways of working by both the top-down and bottom-up
approach.
Create a transformation team with specific roles and
responsibility for individuals and allow them to collaborate
among themselves to try new ideas. In line with Agile-Scrum, I
will like to suggest the three roles as:
Transformation These should be typically the senior management
people at the highest possible level accountable for
implementing the vision or objectives.

Scrum These individuals guide the vision owner and the
transformation team. They also facilitate the implementation
journey in an iterative manner and keep an eye on the
incremental value delivered.
Product owner or Vision/Strategy This individual should be
capable enough to make decisions. He or she is the person
who will be accountable for the implementation of the backlog.
Typically in this situation, it is the CIO or the department head.
You can follow the pilot-based or big-bang way of an
implementation model.

3.2.4 Learn to adapt
It is always easy to sail with the wind. But there will be certain
situations when nothing will go according to our wishes, and we
will be forced to adapt. The best way to adapt is to learn from
the previous cycle of working. Look at the improvements that
you can bring to the next cycle. Pause, look back, and don't
concern yourself with some failed ideas but learn the lesson to
avoid the failure from re-occurring in the future. Listen to every
stakeholder's view. Note the reasoning behind the causes and
prepare an action plan to tackle them.
Listen, engage, and articulate the findings, reason with the facts
and then take your next step to address the basic cause,
discuss the available alternatives, align the option with the
objective, prioritize the solution, and target for closure one at a
time.
Repeat the steps until you find the right solution for your
transformation.

3.2.5 Enhance by continuous improvement
As said earlier, if we are satisfied by achieving a certain goal,
then the journey stops and becomes travel to a destination only.
But in a transformation journey, we need to enhance our
fortitude — our eagerness to go one step more will help us
enhance our success. We need to continually find an opportunity
to improve ourselves and keep the bar high enough to achieve
this.
Never equate the transformation as a change in the
organization. Change should be the by-product of the
transformation activity. Humans generally love to defend their
present turf and resist change. Hence, create continuous
improvement in small increments. In the end, the organization
will have changed without knowing it.

3.3 How can a project manager supervise an Agile
transformation?
This post is a collection of my experiences and notes from
others with whom I have worked. I have also interviewed
different levels of project managers, in various capacities, who
have embraced Agile wholeheartedly. This post is not meant to
blame any individual or any profession, but merely to draw
attention to the pain points of an Agile transformation for a
specific scenario.

3.3.1 Top five challenges of an Agile adaptation
Having worked on various Agile transformation and DevOps
transformation projects, and having acted as a Scrum master for
different teams, I've discovered that there will be challenges in
every project — that is nothing new. I have always taken each
challenge as a learning opportunity, which has enriched my
experience and bolstered my confidence. But which challenge
was the toughest one for me? According to the VersionOne 11th
Annual State of Agile Survey the following are the top five
challenges for adapting to the Agile way of working or scaling
Agile.
Company philosophy or culture at odds with the core Agile
values.
Lack of experience with Agile methods.
Lack of management support.
Organization's general resistance to change.
Lack of business, customer, or product owner.

I also looked at the next six challenges that respondents had
given, but I was unable to find the one that I have faced the
most and was difficult for me to fix. The biggest challenge that
I have faced to date is working under a project manager to
deliver Agile transformation. Have you faced a similar situation?

3.3.2 Eight ways the project manager can improve Agile
transformation
Based on my experiences, to ensure a successful Agile
transformation, the project manager must create these eight
improvements in his or her way of working.

3.3.2.1 Embrace rolling-wave planning and unlearn up-front
planning
Whenever I join a transformation program, the first thing
expected from me is to provide a short-term plan and a long-
term plan for our deliverables. I prefer to give a list of well-
defined, prioritized activities in the form of a product backlog
and then inform the team that I have visibility into, at best, the
next two sprints (each sprint being two to three weeks long).
This way, I do not need to manage the scope and instead can
build detailed GANTT charts.
However, the challenge comes when there's a demand for the
short-term plan (three to four months) and the long-term plan
(six to 10 months). There is nothing wrong in having a plan
upfront, but the level of detail that we look for in a plan is the
point of contention. Also, it depends on your approach to
accepting the frequent change in plan or adjustment of the
goalpost as the result of a new understanding or the
impediments that strike along the way. Any transformation
strategy is like Randomwork in any innovation-minded company,
where you try out different ideas and juggle different priorities
with different stakeholders. Any plan we can design is sure to
change in the future because of unforeseen challenges and
impediments.

In every organization that I have worked for, transformation is
always a side project and not the main focus. As a result, the
teams working on their specific deadlines are not available to
give the time required for the success of the transformation.
Hence, any exhaustive advance planning will never fly.

3.3.2.2 Achieve an Agile mindset through coaching and training
The first thought that crosses a project manager's mind is to
send all team members for Agile foundation training. Members
are usually not part of those sessions or discussions. They think
that by reading or listening to a few seminars on Scrum, they
now know everything, and they start working toward Agile
transformation.
Agile transformation is simple if you understand the essence of
agility and try to live by its values. Merely reading and using
some buzzwords will not bring the required transformation. My
experience teaches me that there is nothing to learn in Agile;
rather, there's a lot more to unlearn. The difficult part of
unlearning can be overcome by training and coaching and
pursuing your individual interests.

3.3.2.3 Focus on timely value delivery
The traditional product manager is tuned to the iron triangle, in
which the scope never changes. By focusing all our energy only
on the scope, we lose the time-to-market competitive advantage.
In the Agile triangle, the scope is flexible, and as a result, we
have the advantage of reprioritizing the work as time progresses,
maintaining the value that is generated. This complements
improvement #1, which recommends rolling-wave planning.
I was never successful in giving a milestone transformational
plan and achieving that target every time because some things
are not quantifiable. I can define a milestone for providing Agile
training to 100 team members per quarter, but I won't be able
to guarantee that they all are following the Agile values. This
effort requires continual engagement, and therefore there will be
lots of tried and tested mentoring for different team members.

3.3.2.4 Learn ways of working over forms and processes
Governance is good, and it is always nice to have an overview
of what is happening and how to improve on it. The governance
meeting has always been a source of contention in any
transformation I have worked on or heard about from other
Agilists. The intention is to work collaboratively to improve, not
to play mud-slinging games. But, unfortunately, this governance,
assessments, and audits have become a yardstick of your
achievement.
The purpose of creating different processes and filling out
documented forms is to help and collaborate with teams. But if
it becomes a repetitive task of filling in the same set of data in
different formats for different stakeholders, then it's a waste.
How many times have people gone back to read the meeting
minutes? Can we look at the alternatives and keep it simple,
with minimal action points to track? Many times I have heard
senior leadership asking why this or that is not done, and why
haven't they been informed about it. Can we change this tone
to ‘how can I help to rectify this so that it will not happen in
the future?’ Or ‘how can I be informed about this in the future
without negatively affecting your work?’ These subtle changes in
our approach will make a significant difference in the ways we

work.

3.3.2.5 Embrace iterative and incremental value delivery and
unlearn phased working
Distinct multiphase project planning phases must become a part
of the past to enable iterative and incremental value delivery.
What is the point of developing a phase that will not create
value for the customer or business? Can we look at different
options to make the different phases linear and repetitive?
Let the team work independently of the plan that senior
management wants to see. If the product manager needs to
present it in a different way, look at the existing ways of
working with the team, and create and maintain your own
template separately. The moment we try to bring our traditional
approach into the Agile ways of project delivery, it will dilute the
essence of Agile philosophy.

3.3.2.6 Build cross-functional teams
The number of handovers that happen in a delivery pipeline is
directly proportional to the delay and waste. If someone is
working on multiple projects, his or her working hours can be
added to reach 100% billability, but in actuality, the individual
will be delivering 70% or less productive value. We all consume
time for context switching between activities.
Product managers must break the organizational silos and build
a cross-functional team that can resolve their own differences
and deliver without any handover or SLA parameter. In this
case, everyone's goal and focus is the same objective.

3.3.2.7 Collaborate with the team to empower it
No one wants to be commanded to do anything; that is basic
human nature. We create an environment in which we command
something and realize short-term benefits, but in the long term,
this approach will backfire, as the team members will be fully
dependent on getting assigned to do their work. Therefore, we
will always have a single point of failure.
There is no quick method of empowering the team. It will take
time until the team realizes the benefit and feels respected. In
the name of maintaining scope, cost, and time, product
managers invariably step into the mindset of getting involved in
everything. Let's give the team members the space and
environment to express themselves. Let the Agile team define
the processes and tasks required to accomplish goals. Try to
facilitate conversation and delivery.
You may feel like you're losing your control and authority, but
the pleasure of working with the team and celebrating successes
together go far beyond those losses.

3.3.2.8 Make goals that are "people and culture" transformations
According to the VersionOne survey, the top objective of every
organization is to increase productivity and the business margin.
I have yet to see an organization whose sole goal is to
transform their people and culture.
I firmly believe that if I can bring this transformation, then all
other objectives will be the by-product of this work. This is the
area that I always look to for the product managers. They are
the folks who are closest to the team, and who have the
highest, most influential ability to bring tremendous
improvement.

3.4 Where is the use of Agile not appropriate?
Agile is not appropriate for the following:
Projects without noticeable complexity, urgency, and novelty
(uniqueness).
Teams which are not self-organizing and do not trust in
inspecting and adapting.
Organizations which do not invest in cross-functional teams and
RandD of good engineering practices (for example, TDD, CI
etc.).
Customers who are not willing to be a part of the product
development team and provide continuous feedback.
Big Bang – Across the board changes without experimentation.
Iterative development without automated tests.
Sprints (iterations) that deliver incomplete work.

Doing mini-waterfalls within the sprint (iterations).
Implementing Agile without believing in its core values and
principles.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

3.5 Successful Agile transitions key enablers
We have to use a systematic approach to transform a team to
Agile in all aspects of its values, principles, and ceremonies. The
transformation depends a lot on the organization's environmental
factors, which you must consider to increase the likelihood of a
successful transition.
Agile transitions begin by assessing environmental factors and
organizational behaviors. Then you methodically create a shared
vision and plan for the to-be status, keeping the long-term
benefits in focus while engaging with all stakeholders.
The following are factors that will help sustain a transition once
it kicks off successfully:
Leaders communicate with the organization through emails or
town hall meetings. They can also communicate at the group
level, on demand.
Change Identify internal practitioners who help orient the team.
Build the team around motivated individuals.

Formal Ensure that the team is formally trained in Agile. If the
team comes with varied experience, it is best practice to have
refresher sessions to engage the team and address all of its
questions.
Clear Focus on Scrum ceremonies and artefacts with respect to
Agile values and principles. Educate the team on the relevance
of each of these activities and work items. Provide many
examples to help them understand. Create a team culture and
ground rules to emphasize the importance of time management,
collaboration, etc. This is an important step in teaching the
team to self-organize.
Obstacle or impediment Train the team to identify the obstacles
and create an environment that facilitates clearing those
obstacles. A focused effort will be helpful in creating a culture in
which the team can identify obstacles, raise them for discussion,
and proactively resolve them.
Backlog Ensure that there's a sufficient and clear backlog and
that you have a continuous team activity in place to build and
refine the product backlog. This motivates the team and helps it
to have a high-level view of the road map.
Cross-functional team A Scrum team is fully functional when it
can complement the skills of other teams and deliver business

value to the customer.
Definition of done and definition of Extract insight into the team
so that you can identify the attributes needed for a user story
or a sprint to determine when the definition of done has been
satisfied.
Empowered team and trusted The team is able to make
decisions, fail faster, learn, correct itself, and be successful.
Address several of the key elements, such as the infrastructure
for continuous integration and continuous delivery, and
automation strategy and planning.
Change Develop effective mechanisms to address overall
changes, address various concerns and technical challenges, and
ensure that activities are on track.
Below are some strategies to overcome the struggles experienced
during the transformation:
Articulate change and It is the executive team that will most
likely initiate the change to Agile. The challenge is to gain the
team's support during the first few steps. Agile encourages
transparency, accountability, and a shared understanding of tasks.

Those initiating the shift are in charge of conveying the benefits
to be gained with taking on an Agile approach, as well as the
overall basics of how Agile will replace the current solutions and
processes. Present to the team a timeline and the reasoning
behind adopting Agile. The team should have a common place
to refer to for this timeline, which should be easily accessible to
everyone impacted. When delivering this communication, keep a
few crucial points in mind: Who is going to be impacted, and
what the benefits are for each team member.
Govern and Encourage each person to ask questions and
provide quick feedback, and offer them assistance. This will help
steer people away from the task-oriented method toward a new
and more motivated attitude. Selectively administer individuals
and their respective undertakings associated with the
transformation. These key players will collaboratively move the
process further and will be held accountable for extending the
Agile practices to others.
Identify people with previous experience and familiarity with
Agile. They should also be involved in current projects,
understand legacy methods, and support the current shift toward
Agile. To ensure flexibility and openness along the way, analyze
any blockers associated with this implementation prior to the
implementation team moving forward. Once this initial plan is
established, have trust in your implementation team, remove any

structural roadblocks, and refrain from frequent interventions.
Influence through open For an Agile transformation to be
successful, the executive team needs to motivate everyone within
the organization. I already mentioned the importance of
communication and clarity as among one of the first steps
toward this change. Another aspect of a successful
transformation is promoting and encouraging engagement
whereby teams are able to submit feedback and volunteer their
ideas. Outdated organizational structures/concepts do not permit
for an open dialogue between management, executive sponsors,
and technical team members. There is a lack of empowerment
and an overabundance of autocracy.
Agile welcomes and encourages contributions from technical
teams and key players, thus eliminating uncertainty. The ultimate
goal, which should be articulated to everyone, is to leverage the
capabilities of each team member, thus maximizing everyone's
talent. The task is to create a safe space at the beginning of
the transformation for teams to collectively provide and receive
feedback. Share the message across teams that Agile emphasizes
a focus on individuals rather than processes and tools.
Coach rather than Abandoning established processes and
structures for the way projects are currently managed can make
you doubt your project manager's ability to maintain full control.

Consider how the Agile approach will be structured and adopted
at all levels, especially if you depend heavily on processes.
Coach rather than instruct through each step, thereby creating
suitable conditions based on your team's culture and dynamics.
This will allow everyone to focus on the tasks at hand and
remove any ambiguity.
Empower and When everyone has a clear understanding of Agile,
continue to improve the communication system. By adopting an
efficient communication structure, teams will continue delivering
proper in-time feedback and, most importantly, it will keep
everyone engaged and motivated. All teams should be well aware
of ongoing tasks within their projects, which will strengthen
Agile's value regarding clarity.
Agile is about aligning with strategic objectives of each project
while collaborating with both internal teams and client
stakeholders. Continue investing in your team. Your team will be
convinced by their results after unevenness and overburdening
are eliminated. Project tasks will feel easier and will boost
overall productivity.
Strategies to handle urgent changes in the middle of the
Sometimes in the middle of the sprint, the customer or product
owner submits urgent requirements or requests, which weren't
planned in the sprint planning meeting, and which disturb the

smooth flow of the sprint. This often happens when we are
implementing Scrum in service operations or a highly complex
and unpredictable project.
Although Scrum is designed to allow for flexibility and to handle
uncertainty in projects, it still ensures that one sprint is given to
the team to focus on a set of requirements that were locked
during the sprint planning. If we take on additional demands in
the middle of the sprint, it's a clear violation of the Scrum
framework. However, it is hard to refuse the customer or
convince him or her that the requests will be taken up in the
next sprint. After all, we are working for their dollars.
Here are six strategies that you might want to consider if you
have this problem. Other innovative ways might exist, so I
would love to hear about them:
Have a contingency If, as a general trend, many requests are
brought up during the sprint planning meeting, set aside some
portion of your time to deal with the unexpected. But don't
make it more than 20% of the meeting, because you might get
into the habit of taking less work in each sprint.
Achieve the sprint The purpose of the sprint is to achieve the
sprint goal. User stories can be added or dropped in the middle
of the sprint. So if we have to take up some new requests, our

sprint goal should be such that we are able to meet it despite
working on some new user stories while dropping a few planned
user stories.
Shorten the If this is something that happens quite often, then
it might be a good idea to have shorter sprints. The shorter the
sprint, the better we respond to uncertainty. For example, if we
have a one-week sprint, then we can take up the new user story
in the next sprint, which is just a week away — as opposed to
a four-week sprint, in which the new item can be delivered only
after a month.
Secure customer If the customer is willing to understand how
Scrum works and the reason behind sprints and iterations, it
might be worth getting their buy-in. If we have buy-in, we can
safely put it in the product backlog, and it will also help us in
future sprints.
Apply Kanban or If Scrum is not suited for this scenario,
Kanban is also an option, as there is no concept of sprints, and
requirements can come at any time and be tackled at any point.
The only issue is that we'll have to restrict the work-in-progress,
which can, again, cause problems in managing the work. A
blend of Scrum and Kanban, which is called Scrumban, might
work. But it's not recommended, as we might just become
sandwiched between the two frameworks and lose track

altogether.
Cancel the In the worst-case scenario, if because of new user
stories the sprint goal becomes totally irrelevant, then we have
no choice but to cancel the sprint and start a new sprint by
planning and taking new user stories.
There is no right or wrong way. Choose whatever suits your
team the best without breaking the Scrum framework and
annoying the customer.

Let's have some review questions.

Questions
You are an Agile Coach. Your Agile project team is in turmoil,
and you're trying to diagnose the level of their conflict with
another department. You notice that statements such as
"marketing has no clue again!" are becoming common place.
What level of would you say the team is experiencing?
Level 1
Level 2
Level 3
Level 4
Level 5
Your team seems to unproductively debate even on trivial
decisions. To help them make collective decisions, as an Agile
coach, you could try using:

Fist-of-five voting
Bare fist fighting
Planning Poker
Bain-storing
Simple voting
You have been assigned as an Agile coach to lead a distributed
Agile team(s). To help them communicate, the best option would
be to:
Ask the team members to share photos of themselves.
Require a common language for all project communications.
Set up some initial face-to-face meetings for everyone to meet
each other.
Define common working hours so everyone can better
communicate.

Both a and b.
Which of the following is not a recommendation for one-on-one
coaching?
Meet them a half-step ahead.
Create positive regard.
Partner with managers.
Let the team resolve conflicts.
Both b and c.
As an Agile coach, you want to avoid:
Prioritizing team goals over individual goals.
Providing rewards for expected behavior.
Finding out what motivates the team members individually.
Rewarding individual goals at the expense of project goals.

Both a and b.
If the Agile coach is effective, we would expect to see an Agile
team:
Collaborate smoothly and harmoniously without disagreements.
Disagree with each other frequently when they are fast learning
to work together.
Learn to suppress their disagreements for the good of the
project.
Develop stronger opinions and disagree more as the project
progresses.
Both a and c.
Another Agile coach in your organization comes to you for
advice. She's having trouble getting her team to take ownership
of the project and get comfortable selecting the work to be
done. She keeps finding herself making the decisions and
directing their work. What do you advise her to do?

At the stand-up meetings, assign a different person each day as
the decision-maker to get them all comfortable in the role.
Implement an incentive plan and officially report any lack of
participation to the team members' functional managers.
Meet them halfway and work with their functional managers to
align each team member's goals with the project goals.
Explain to them that Agile teams self-select their work and tell
them to get on with it.
Both b and d.
Making sure the team's Agile practices are working well and
helping the team to fulfil their Agile roles is an example of:
Coaching
Training
Teaching
Self-organizing

Performance tracking
You are working as an Agile coach and sometimes using the
Shu-Ha-Ri model. Cockburn's Shu-Ha-Ri model tells us why:
Agile teams that are empowered to make their own local
decisions are more effective.
Team members tend to argue a lot before they learn to work
well together.
Leaders need to understand how teams develop to lead them
effectively.
Teams new to Agile should follow a method that has already
been tested by others.
Both a and c.

4.1 Challenges commonly present in daily stand-up meetings and
how to tackle them
In general terms, the daily Scrum is a short, everyday meeting,
ideally held during the start of the workday. Each team member
who works towards the completion of a given sprint must
participate in this meeting. During the meeting, each team
member must provide brief answers to the following three
questions:
What have you accomplished since the last daily Scrum meeting?
What are you going to accomplish until the next Scrum
meeting?
What are the impediments that prevent you from accomplishing
your tasks?
All the team members must attend and stand during the
meeting. The daily Scrum should ideally not last more than 15
minutes. But there are certain challenges that arise during these
meetings, which the Scrum master must tackle. Otherwise, the
results of the Scrum meeting may be disappointing and not
good for the project.

4.2 Our team's challenges
The following are some of the challenges that we faced in our
project.

4.2.1 Some members were not willing to attend or didn't attend
regularly
Let's see some key pointers.
If anyone was not able to attend the meeting because the
meeting was scheduled early in the morning, we rescheduled the
time so that everyone could attend.
If anyone was purposely missing the meeting, we penalized
them by having them provide chocolates to all other team
members in the meeting.
The location of the stand-up meeting was easily accessible for
all team members to attend, and it was never changed.
We educated the team members on the fact that this was not a
status update meeting wherein they informed the Scrum master
of the status of their tasks.

4.2.2 Some members were not providing proper updates to the
team
If anyone was not providing updates, we counseled them and
discussed the actual problem. If it was attributable to fear or
shyness, we helped them with providing updates during the
meeting and appreciated their effort.
We ensured that the team members were aware of what they
had to update in the stand-up before their attendance.
For the first few days and for the benefit of new members of
the Scrum team, we discussed what they would be discussing in
the stand-up meeting and helped them with correcting and
formulating the proper information before attending. This helped
them to confidently provide proper updates.

4.2.2.1 Some members were not paying attention in the stand-up
meeting
We randomly updated the speaker order during the meeting. We
simply picked a team member who was not paying attention
and asked him to update us.
To increase attention, we usually followed commonly used
techniques, such as using a rugby ball or tennis ball that was
passed from one team member to another randomly, so that
each member remained attentive and ready to catch the ball at
any moment — in other words, they remained ready to provide
an update.

4.2.2.2 Some members were not accountable for their tasks
At the start of each sprint, we assigned user stories to each
team member and informed them of their accountability.
Each day we followed up with the team member to get his or
her update.
We circulated a daily update email internally to each team
member about the development. The email also included a chart
that showed the percentage of completion for a specific user
story.
We created awareness among the team members that each one
was responsible for their user story from the beginning to the
end until the status could be changed to "done" in Jira.
Team members were taught the importance of the user story
and were involved in all the discussions with the client so that
each member assumed accountability.
We offered awards and recognition during the sprint
retrospective meeting for the team members who had completed

their tasks most efficiently in the sprint.

4.2.3 Conclusion
The daily stand-up meeting helps to sync the team members
and identifies how well the team is progressing towards the
sprint goal. Each team member should address his or her
statements to the other team members, which cultivates a
collaborative atmosphere. It is the duty of the Scrum master to
make these meetings fruitful and to contribute to the success of
the sprints.

4.3 We are Agile, but we are using Scrum-but
Let's discuss some important pointers on these.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the below are possible
abbreviations. We've said that Agile is a mindset, not a specific
set of practices, and many Agile teams end up tailoring their
Agile methodology for their own circumstances.

4.3.1 We are Agile and using Scrum! But…
Many software developments teams worldwide have changed
their way of working to follow the Scrum framework. As part of
this change, some teams follow only parts of the framework and
omit some key elements. Whenever a prescribed role or
ceremony is omitted, it likely impacts the quality or the outcome
of the team's work.
Based on my experience, here is a list of the usual omissions
— and reasons why I think they should not be omitted. I'm
sure that you have experienced some other omissions, so feel
free to leave a comment about your experience.

4.3.2 No full-time Scrum master
Some teams operate without a dedicated person in the role of a
Scrum master. In such cases, one of the Scrum team members
doubles up as a developer, tester, or business analyst and
Scrum master. This person is usually stretched between these
two responsibilities and faces challenges in trying to fulfill each
role to the team's expectation and satisfaction.
The Scrum team should have a dedicated Scrum master. The
number of concurrent teams that a Scrum master can work with
can range from one to three, based on the team size, nature of
work, and comfort with the Scrum framework. A great Scrum
master will help the team to become highly efficient as a
collaborative unit that works cohesively towards the product
vision.

4.3.3 No product owner
Some teams have a proxy product owner or are missing one
completely. A proxy product owner is one who is not actively
performing the role of a Product Owner (PO) for the team and
is only available occasionally to answer questions about the
product. Another setup in which the proxy product owner is
useful is when the work is done by a business analyst on the
team, in consultation with a group of product experts, and one
of them is the designated PO for the team depending on the
feature being worked on. In both setups, the team suffers. The
number of communication loops that are added severely limit
the team's ability to create working, tested software in every
sprint that the PO can review and accept. Because multiple
people provide input to the team, the chances of some of them
not getting their fulfilled are very high. This could result in
stories not being accepted or changes coming in all the time.
A dedicated and empowered PO who is readily available to the
team enables them to become productive; frequent feedback
from the PO ensures that their working, tested software will
meet the customer's needs and has higher chances of getting
accepted.

4.3.4 No timeboxed iterations
Some teams feel the urge to extend their sprint end-dates
whenever their user stories are not done. At other times, they
end their sprints when the work they had planned gets blocked
or they finish the work early. Sprints that have durations all over
the place take away a very important attribute of a Scrum team:
predictability.
Teams that follow timeboxed iterations can use their velocity and
capacity trends from previous iterations to forecast when the
remaining work can be done. This forecasting enables their
organization to line up releases and set expectations with their
customers. By removing this predictability, organizations are
either unable to forecast release dates to their customers or
stick to predefined dates that their teams may or may not be
able to realistically achieve.
Teams must keep their iterations timeboxed, which enables them
to make every effort to meet their commitments. They can
leverage the outcomes of such sprints to forecast and seek help
based on the challenges they foresee.

4.3.5 Don't follow all ceremonies and activities
Some teams are comfortable following only some of the Scrum
ceremonies and choose to avoid other ceremonies.

4.3.5.1 Sprint retrospectives
I've observed that the sprint retrospective is the ceremony that
gets neglected the most, followed by the sprint review and the
showcase or demo. The retrospective is a difficult ceremony to
conduct meaningfully. The teams that have challenges meeting
their sprint commitments are those that are most likely to avoid
the retrospective meeting, thereby losing out on the golden
opportunity to identify improvements and seek help. Some teams
express that they don't have any problems, and hence they don't
need to retrospect. In cases when this is true, the retrospective
meeting could be done at a different frequency or in a
technique that expressly helps the team recognize their
achievements and move on.

4.3.5.2 Sprint reviews
The other ceremony that is neglected is the sprint review. In
cases in which the PO is not actively involved, these reviews are
conducted for the sake of compliance, and the team sleepwalks
through user stories (some that may not even be done!). The
ability of the PO to review their work throughout the sprint is
overlooked, and the chance to provide feedback is completely
missed. These teams will often near their product releases with
several surprises and challenges. Teams that have an accessible
PO can work with the individual to get work to the done state
throughout the sprints. Because of the PO's availability, the
product increment can be showcased to a wider set of
stakeholders to apprise them of the progress made and also
seek their feedback.

4.3.5.3 Daily stand-ups
The Daily Stand-Up meeting — though usually conducted —
gets abused because of the format and content. The team
members often ramble about the work done and the issues
faced. This ceremony meanders into issue resolution sessions in
which the team spends upwards of 30 minutes (sometimes an
hour or more!). Focusing on the work accomplished and
presenting impediments — but staying away, at this point, from
resolving them — will keep the DSU brief, focused, and
meaningful.

4.3.6 No backlog of prioritized items
During a sprint, the Scrum teams commit to a set of user
stories from a prioritized product backlog for development.
Whenever they are impeded, they should have the ability to work
with the PO and select some other user story from their
product backlog to develop. When the PO does not have a
backlog that the teams can dip into in such cases, the team's
ability to use their capacity is constrained. Productivity takes a
hit, and teams spend time doing less important work.
POs must constantly create user stories, review them with their
development teams, and get them ready for future sprints. Some
teams set a target to have two or three sprints' worth of work
ready in their backlog so that they are never starved. The
development activity keeps churning out the most important
features in every sprint. Teams that don't have a prioritized and
ready product backlog will also be disconnected from the
product vision; team members are confused about the next set
of features they will work on. This distraction generates several
other side effects, such as misalignment, lack of interest, missed
product vision, etc.
A healthy backlog ensures that a team is always aligned with the

product vision. By being involved in the backlog refinement
activities, the team will be aligned to the most important set of
features and will actively engage in the success of the product.

4.3.7 No dedicated team members
Some organizations are unable to assign dedicated members to
teams. By design, members are expected to either work with
multiple teams simultaneously or keep changing teams after
every sprint. Such splitting of time or random rotation of team
members prevents the formation of a team and keeps members
guessing about what they are expected to focus on next.
Teams that work well together can expect better outcomes and
overcome challenges more easily as compared to a unit of
discreet and disoriented members. Teams whose members are
working across multiple teams often leave other team members
struggling to cope with the unavailability of the capacity when
they are needed. This will dampen interest in the work and at
times even impact the quality of the output.
The Scrum team members are expected to collaborate, help each
other, and have the backs of others on the team. Because of
these attributes, they are often able to overcome roadblocks that
would normally stop ordinary teams in their tracks, and they
achieve their goals.

4.3.8 Don't deliver done stories in every sprint
When teams don't have dedicated members, a well-defined and
prioritized backlog, and a loose implementation of the
framework, they struggle to create working, tested software at
every iteration. The definition of ready and the definition of done
should normally guide the team in getting their user stories
done according to their own agreements. At such times, teams
struggle to gain the PO's acceptance of the product increment
they have developed (their interpretation of it!)
A combination of dedicated team members, a healthy backlog,
and adherence to the Scrum framework will increase the chances
of a team delivering working, tested software each sprint and
getting them accepted each sprint. Working agreements that
make sense and a definition of ready and definition of done that
matter are often at the foundation of successful teams.
What is your experience? I'd love to hear the challenges you've
faced and how they've impacted your teams.

4.3.9 We do not plan, we are Agile
In reality, planning is being done at 5 levels – product vision
planning, product roadmap planning, release planning, iteration
planning, and daily planning.

4.3.10 We do not design, we are Agile
In reality, iteration zero is used for all planning and set up
activities. Architecture and design are done but evolve
throughout the project.

4.3.11 We do not do documentation, we are Agile
In reality, do as much documentation as required by your
context.

4.4 Five common stand-up malpractices
Stand-up is one of the most popular terms that Agile newbies
immediately associate with the Agile/Scrum process. Many
organizations that claim they are practicing an Agile-based
development process are eager to tout that they do stand-ups as
if that were some sort of irrefutable proof that they are Agile.
While there may be other issues with their Agile practices, I
want to focus on a few common errors or loose practices that
often get woven into stand-ups.
The three-question format is missing. We know that the three
questions posed during a stand-up are: What did I work on or
accomplish yesterday? What do I plan to work on or accomplish
today? What are my impediments?
Daily stand-ups must follow this three-question format. However,
instead of doing so, Scrum newbie teams often practice free-
form updates at these so-called stand-ups. Such updates are
filled with details and possibly even ambiguous statements,
rendering the stand-up a Waterfall status meeting. The value and
criticality of using the three questions at a stand-up is a bigger
topic that falls outside the scope of this article, so I will not get
into it here. What's important to understand is that if a stand-

up is not based on the three-question updates, its effectiveness
is heavily diluted.
The duration of stand-ups is more than 15 to 20 minutes. There
is a reason why stand-ups are expected to be shorter than 20
minutes. This is the universal standard recommended by the
founders and leading evangelists of Scrum. If a stand-up is
conducted or practiced properly, it is almost a given that it will
be wrapped up in 20 minutes or less. However, organizations
that practice a loose version of the stand-up routinely take up
anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes. This should be a warning sign
that significant coaching is needed to get such stand-ups in an
efficient order so that they align with the recommended standard
time limit.
The task board is not used during the stand-up. For those who
are not familiar with the task board, it gives a view that
represents all the tasks that have been taken on by different
team members in a given sprint. Enterprise Agile applications,
such as Rally and Jira Agile, have built-in views that delineate all
tasks in a given sprint.
Using a task board during the stand-up by displaying it on a
screen or web conference tool enhances the effectiveness of
stand-ups, because the entire Scrum team can follow along while
each member gives his or her updates. Among other benefits,

the Scrum master can correlate the updates with the actual
status on the board. Some organizations underestimate the value
of using task boards during stand-ups, thereby creating a
possible vacuum or gap between what gets said at a stand-up
and any follow-up action or question that may have to be taken
or asked based on it.
The team is sitting during the stand-up. Believe it or not, some
organizations that have jumped on the Agile bandwagon without
proper coaching think that standing up during a stand-up is a
superfluous action — something that is for show only. This is a
naïve assumption that is typically the result of poor guidance.
Standing up brings urgency and speed to the stand-up meeting,
which in the long-run keeps these meetings focused and
therefore efficient.
Stand-ups are not held daily. It's no accident that it is called
the "daily" stand-up, not the or or stand-up. Scrum development
is fast-paced, and significant progress is made daily on tasks,
not to mention that issues and blockers crop up frequently that
need a coordinated effort to put to bed. In the absence of a
daily stand-up, sprint execution will very likely suffer.
By making a conscious effort to avoid these missteps, you will
be well on your way to practicing crisp and effective stand-up
meetings.

Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

4.5 Common sprint review anti-patterns
The sprint review meeting occurs at the end of every sprint.
Teams fail to inspect and adapt effectively if they fail to conduct
meaningful review meetings.
The common sprint review meeting anti-patterns include:
Treating the review meeting as a demo.
Management taking over the meeting.
Skipping reviews and absent team members.
Business/user/client always absent in sprint review.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

4.6 Common sprint retrospective anti-patterns
Continuous improvement is at the heart of Agile. Retrospectives
provide opportunities for the teams to inspect their process, and
continuously improve it. Many teams fail to take advantage of
this and thus fail to improve. Common anti-patterns associated
with retrospectives are:
Infrequent retrospectives.
Ignoring improvement actions.
Lack of team participation.
Long and painful debates.
Let's see some important pointers on it.

Contingency plan
The Scrum master should work with the whole Scrum team to
identify improvement ideas. They should work together to identify
and select a few ideas for the upcoming sprints. These ideas
need a discussion that is more detailed. Tasks and to-do items
for these improvement ideas should be shared with the whole
team. These should be visible. If the team has a physical board,
it is a good idea to stick these action items on the board, in a
separate section. The same should happen when the team is
using an electronic tool. This will ensure that the discussed and
agreed ideas remain visible during the sprint and the team does
not forget them.
The Scrum master should work with the team and the product
owner to ensure that they understand the meaning of review
and retrospective meeting. The process improvement should be
discussed during the retrospective meeting. It is a good idea for
the Scrum master to schedule separate review and retrospective
meetings. The schedule can be agreed at the end of the planning
or well in advance for several coming sprints.
Product owner participation is crucial while the team is
identifying improvement areas and devising improvement

suggestions. The Scrum master should guide and coach the
product owner and the team to convince them of the
importance of the retrospective and continuous improvement.
A retrospective is not a forum for the Scrum master to spoon-
feed the team with the best solutions. The Scrum master should
facilitate the retrospective meeting. The retrospective is a
meeting for the whole Scrum team to discuss the process and
come up with improvements ideas. Setting up a Scrum master
community of practice, as discussed in the Master on chapter
ensures that the Scrum masters do not get complacent and they
keep abreast of the Scrum values and principles.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible

We've said that Agile is a mindset, not a specific set of
practices, and many Agile teams end up tailoring their Agile
methodology for their own circumstances.

4.7 Common daily Scrum anti-patterns
The daily Scrum is a 15-minute Scrum event meant for the
development team members. It poses many challenges because
of its limited timebox. Disruptions to the flow of the meeting
reduce the effectiveness of the daily Scrum.
Common daily Scrum anti-patterns are:
Design and development discussions.
Product owner takes over the meeting.
Team reports to the Scrum master.
Latecomers and absent members.
It's a status call.
Daily Scrum is happening every day for 2 hours.
Let's see some important pointers on it.

Contingency plan
The daily Scrum is a short timeboxed meeting that enables the
team to inspect and adapt on a daily basis. The Scrum master
should guide and coach the team to help them understand the
value of a daily Scrum. Certainly, some items discussed during
the daily Scrum require discussion in detail. Those items should
be discussed once the meeting is over. The team should self-
organize to decide who needs to get involved in the follow-up
discussions.
The daily Scrum is meant for the development team. It enables
them to inspect and adapt on a daily basis. It is not a meeting
for the product owner and other stakeholders. The Scrum master
should work with the product owner and the stakeholders to
help them understand the concept of the daily Scrum and the
timeboxes. The product owner and stakeholders may attend the
meeting, if they so wish, but they are discouraged from talking.
Only the team members talk during the daily Scrum. The
product owner and others are free to talk to the team members
once the daily Scrum is over.

The daily Scrum is a meeting for the team. It is not a status-
gathering meeting for the Scrum master. It is not even
necessary for the Scrum master to be present during the daily
Scrum, rather the Scrum master should ensure that the team
goes ahead and conducts this meeting daily. Certainly, the team
does not report to the Scrum master. The master community of
idea discussed in the Master on chapter can help Scrum masters
refresh the Scrum concepts and keep them from becoming
complacent.
The Scrum master should help the team understand the value
of daily Scrums. The daily Scrum is a meeting for the team. If
members turn up late, the team suffers as a result. The team
should devise a plan to discourage members from turning up
late. Several teams agree on a small fine (and they give the
money to a charitable cause), or another penalty which keeps
members on their toes.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

4.8 Common velocity anti-patterns
Velocity is the number of items a team delivers during a sprint.
It is measured in story points, number of items, hours or
another unit. It gives the team an indication of how many items
it will be able to complete in the coming sprints. It provides no
more information than this. A couple of velocity related anti-
patterns are:
Velocity optimization
Velocity comparison
Let's see some important pointers on it.

Contingency plan
Velocity is a tool for the team. It is not a performance measure.
Using it to measure performance is akin to using lines of code
to measure developer productivity. It leads to increased output,
but not to increased productivity, performance, or value.
Reward and performance appraisal must not jeopardize the team
element of Agile and Scrum. Different rewards and performance
measures are necessary for Agile and Scrum teams. These
measures and rewards should be team-based. These measures
should support teamwork and Agile and Scrum values.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

4.9 Anti-patterns of product backlog grooming
The team, the product owner, and related stakeholders do not
know:
Where the product backlog is stored.
What items are on the product backlog.
How often it is updated.
What is the current version of the product backlog.
Confusing product backlog format.
Ineffective planning prior to product backlog grooming.
Whether product backlog is ready.
Whether we missed or wasted any opportunities.

Let's see some important pointers on it.

Contingency plan
The following is a typical agenda for a product backlog
grooming session:
The product owner presents new requirements added to the
product.
Backlog, these items are discussed. The time spent on these
items depends on the item order. If the items need to be
developed in the next few sprints (next two to three sprints),
the team and the product owner spend more time on discussing
these items, otherwise discussion of these items is limited in
detail. The team works with the product owner to identify any
missing items.
They add detail to the existing items on the product backlog.
Typically, the team helps the product owner identify technical
and implementation related risks and dependencies. This
discussion leads to new items and the modification of some
existing items. This discussion often affects the order of the
product backlog.

Conducting more discussion on the items planned to be
included in the next three sprints (at this point). If any of these
items are large, the team works with the product owner to break
down these items. Each of these items should take less than
one sprint's worth of work.
Acceptance criteria are added to the newly added and broken-
down items with special clarification on the items planned for
the next three sprints.
Newly added items are sized. Any existing items are resized, if
necessary.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

4.10 Some causes of undone work and long releases
Many Agile and Scrum teams struggle with long release cycles,
despite adopting Agile. Sprint after sprint, they produce work,
but the work is not shippable, it is not They select a few items
from the product backlog every sprint, but by the end of the
sprint, most of the selected items are not completed. This
frustrates the product owner (and the team) to no end.

Symptoms and consequences
Obvious symptoms include:
The team finishing with large amounts of undone work at the
end of most of their sprints. It takes them several sprints to
stabilize the functionality they have already built to make it
release-ready. Pushing out a release takes painfully long.
The estimates, plans, and projections keep changing frequently.
It is difficult to know how long it would take to complete
specific features.
The team is stressed. As the release schedule approaches, the
team is forced to put in extra hours. Still, the problem keeps
getting worse.
Let's see some important pointers on it.

Typical causes
Major factors that contribute to this are
The team is not cross-functional.
Unclear or absent definition of
Technical debt.
Overworked team.
Late integration.
Change of scope during sprints.
Ineffective planning.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

4.11 Some challenges of becoming a cross-functional team
Teams struggle to become cross-functional because of many
reasons, some of the most important ones are:
Waterfall setup of the organization.
Lack of required skills.
"Hard roles" on the team.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible

4.12 Anti-patterns of task estimates
The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Good things are
not always used in the right way. Science, charity, information
— they can all be used in good or potentially bad ways. We are
seeing some of that in Scrum. In many cases, Agile concepts
are being used in counterproductive ways. It is not rare to find
cases where Agile is interpreted to be an only The ecosystem
does not change. Agile values such as empowerment, technical
excellence, and collaboration lose their importance.
If companies want their money's worth from an Agile
transformation, they need put in a true Agile champion in a
position of influence. Agile is not designed to make things look
good while maintaining existing structures. The Agile Manifesto
was supposed to be disruptive. Use of a tool without the
knowledge of what it’s intended for can very often lead to
disaster. Tasking is one such tool.
Let's stop estimating tasks.
Interpretations of tasks (tasking of stories) seem to be getting
more counterproductive every day. Ron for example, seems to be

unhappy about what happened to story points. I think they are
potentially the quickest way to roll back Agility.
I see teams planning task estimates against team capacity, thus
bypassing story points.
Task estimates may be used to micro-manage the team from
outside.
In an earlier article, I pointed out a simple rule of thumb. All
metrics that originate within the sprint are for the team’s
internal use only. Incorrect use of tasking tool seems to be
getting more popular by the day. I would recommend:
Break down the story into tasks until it helps you plan out the
tactical activities in the sprint.
Do not estimate tasks (doesn't buy us much, but has
downsides).
Retrospect on if the task helped, or should a different tasking
method be used.
Perhaps we can stop tasking in the future?

As the team matures it knows its product better and better. As
the team becomes better, they can hopefully get through the
sprint without tasking (or maybe use informal tasking). The only
tasks the team should then have are occasional spikes. The goal
is to:
Continuously improve and get better with story point estimates.
Make sprints more predictable and hence more plannable.
Use Scrum to plan more effectively and not to account for who
spent time where.
Task estimates are becoming an anti-pattern, stay away from
estimates of hours.

4.13 Anti-patterns of Agile – Traps of Agilefall
You are right: Agilefall is not a word. I made it up while
working with an organization that was transitioning from
Waterfall to Agile but was stuck tightly to its Waterfall principles.
We had to translate the product/sprint backlog into a Microsoft
project plan and create Gantt charts for development and QA
that were completed in the sprints. This is a common problem
with teams that are transitioning from Waterfall projects (or even
starting with Agile). It is hard to imagine any team transitioning
from traditional Waterfall to Agile without facing any challenges.
If you have worked in a particular way for a long time, it's
difficult to change course and switch to something new. We all
experience these hurdles when we try to change our habits. But
sometimes we need to get rid of bad habits, don't we? So if
you really want to move to Agile, you have to come out of your
Waterfall comfort zone. I have encountered some common
issues when helping teams transition from Waterfall to Agile.
You might have encountered similar ones, so let me share my
experiences and actions that might help you to tackle similar
challenging situations.

Overcoming challenges
Any organization that decides to transition to Agile has to get
buy-in from its leadership. I presented the pros and cons for
both Waterfall and Agile and got consensus from the project
management office to start transitioning projects to Agile in
phases. It is a significant investment at the beginning, so you
need to make sure that your organization is ready to commit to
the training and tools and to the effort involved.
Also, hire Agile coaches and Scrum masters with project
management experience who know both worlds and can
understand the concerns by drawing from their own experiences
and challenges.
Once the leadership is committed to supporting the Agile
transformation, look for pilot teams. Your ideal pilot team
includes a few members with Agile experience. We had some
team members who were reluctant to move to Agile. They had
many concerns that stemmed from beliefs that Scrum is only a
mini Waterfall, that the team wastes a lot of time in
ceremonies, or that it's just another way to micromanage
people. My advice is to go slow.

Let your teams realize the need for Scrum events and come
back to you, rather than you setting up all the ceremonies from
the beginning. I started with only two-week commitments and
daily stand-ups. I let them adjust and understand Agile gradually.
After two sprints, the team itself realized that they needed a
clear scoping of the stories, and I introduced grooming sessions
to define the scope and added acceptance criteria. After the
fourth sprint, the team realized that they were either
overcommitted or under committed, and they were looking for
ways to judge their capacity. I added a planning session that
helped them understand capacity planning. By the fifth sprint,
the team was able to give demos to the leadership and other
stakeholders, as well as to improve burndown charts and
velocity.

Buy-in from management and stakeholders
Once you see that the pilot teams are running well — after
perhaps five to six sprints — you can include Waterfall project
managers from other teams into your team demos. Let them
see the benefits of having deliverables in two weeks. When I
involved project managers from other teams, they were excited
to see the demos. They had never seen anything tangible for
other projects until the very end. Demoing and continuous
communication made our client collaborative and supportive.
This was the trigger point for other managers, who were
struggling to get approvals from clients and looking for more
feedback. The lack of timely feedback is a deadlock in the
traditional Waterfall model, as the team cannot move to
development until all the requirements and design are approved.
At the same time, the client is unable to provide clear
requirements without seeing a working product. Clients provide
better suggestions and feedback when they see something
tangible, rather than a proof-of-concept out of flow charts and
bullet points.

Recruiting experience from both Agile and Waterfall
When you are able to show the benefits of Agile to other
managers and convince leadership that Agile really works, you
will have started a revolution in the organization that will make
all the difference. It sounds simple, and that's the beauty of
Agile. It looks straightforward, but mastering and executing the
process is hard. That's when you need coaches who have
implemented projects in both methods. Otherwise, if you have a
traditional Waterfall manager just moving to a Scrum master
role, you will see the stand-ups become status meetings, where
the so-called "Scrum master" takes notes, defines action items,
and follows up with the team throughout the day.

Increase the probability of success
If you decide to move to Agile, you have to believe in and
commit to its fundamentals. You have to make sure that your
leadership gives you the green light. You should never go full-on
Agile from the beginning; instead, allow the team to understand
and incorporate the principles gradually in their daily work. The
whole process requires time and patience. But if you really
understand the benefits and believe in Agile, you will be
successful.

Product backlog DEEP structure
A product backlog is best described as DEEP.
Detailed Higher-order items are more detailed and well
understood compared to the lower order items.
The product backlog items are estimated in relative sizes by the
development team. The product owner orders the items based
on the value and the cost.
The product backlog is a living artifact. It is always updated for
details, estimates and order. The life of the product backlog is
the same as the life of the product itself.
The product backlog items are ordered based on the priority.
The order is force ranking (1,2,3…) so that there are no
competing priorities.

Figure 4.1: Product backlog DEEP structure Source:
The primary goal of product backlog refinement is to get ready
with a few items for the upcoming one or two sprints. The
product backlog items that are refined are deemed "ready" for
selection in sprint planning.
Product backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates,
and order to the items in the product backlog. Product backlog
refinement is an ongoing activity throughout a Scrum project.
The team and the product owner decide the frequency and
duration of the backlog refinement meeting. However, it is

timeboxed at 10% of the total available time.

5.1 Kanban key takeaways
Kanban Maturity Model is an organizational maturity guiding tool
to understand where you are, define your purpose, determine
your route towards the purpose, walk the path and track
progress.
The KMM provides guidelines on actions to take, creating just
enough stress to drive improvement without overreaching
— David J. Anderson and Tedoroa Bozheva

Figure 5.1a: Kanban maturity model Source:
We may use KMM to invoke organizational changes in an
evolutionary way by breaking the process down into five iterative
steps:

Define the appraisal scope
Appraise the Kanban practices
Appraise the cultural values
Identify barriers to the next maturity level
Define your roadmap
As workshop exercises, we used our own organizations as
examples and tried to apply the above steps in a guided
manner. Through the exercises, questions such as to appraise
cultural and should be doing the spawned, which created some
great discussions.

Key takeaways
Assess organizational maturity through current practices and
observations on cultural values.
Use cultural values instead of practices as motivation for
improvement.
Visualize the evolution of multiple programs through the KMM.
Why we liked It was pragmatic. After the workshop, we knew
how to apply this five-step process to define the organizational
agility improvement roadmap.
Breaking the plateau with KMM
We may use KMM to assist the business/customer to invoke
organizational improvement using the KMM as part of the
business process reengineering exercise. We can assess the
client's current situation, the result of the maturity assessment,
along with relevant recommendations to the company.

One important message is the phenomenon of overreaching.
Overreaching happened when coaches introduced higher maturity
level practices to an organization who did not have the cultural
values from the same maturity level.
We may the following example to illustrate overreaching for
easier consumption.

Kanban maturity model values
Figure 5.1b: Kanban maturity model values Source:
The KMM exists to drive the appropriate application of Kanban
practices. The KMM prevents both failure modes seen in Kanban
implementations. The KMM maps 130+ Kanban practices against
organizational maturity levels and provides a map for appropriate
practice adoption.
We must strive to create an organization of at least maturity
level 4.

Example to illustrate overreaching for easier consumption
Let's depict some example(s) to illustrate overreaching for easier
consumption:
Figure 5.2: Example to illustrate overreaching for easier consumption
Source: medium.com)
As shown in the KMM above, the coaches had marked their
client's existing values and practices in green. From the location
of the green boxes, we can see that their client is currently in
maturity level 1. In order to elevate their maturity, they use their
desired values as motivations for change and introduced
transition practices to disrupt their equilibrium (see blue boxes).
This is a healthy evolutionary change.

However, if they were to introduce practices from maturity level
3 in this situation (see white boxes), then this would be
considered overreaching. Since the appropriate values are not in
place, the overreaching practices tend to be short-lived due to
resistance.

Key takeaways
Misalignment between values and practices result in a limited
business outcome.
The three improvement pillars are business purpose, values, and
practice adoptions.
The concept of capacity is taken as physical work-in-process limit
for a department/team.
Why we liked It was a great complement to the KMM session
because it connected the pragmatic materials in the workshop
with a real-life example.
Dynamic reservation systems — Better scheduling for
upcoming work by David Anderson
Dependency generally happens when a group (the calling service,
e.g. development) need to call upon another group (the called
service, for example, UX) for assistance to fulfil a customer
request. Unfortunately, there are times when such request for
assistance is in a limbo stage waiting to be picked up in the
queue, which negatively impacts the predictability of the overall

delivery to the customer.
This happens more often than we would like, so how should we
reserve capacity from the called service such that we could
minimize the adverse effect of dependencies?
David showed that by observing the historical throughput of the
called service, we could define three different classes of capacity
reservation (see the following image).
Defining classes of service
Based on historical data, a minimum of 15 items were
completed by the called service every week, so they could almost
guarantee a replenishment of up to 15 items next week.
Continuing the thought process, their average weekly throughput
was 26 items, so there was a 50% chance for them to pick up
26 items next week. Finally, there was one instance where they
completed a maximum of 44 items in a week, so there would
be a 5% chance that they could pick up 44 items next week.
After gathering the confidence levels and their respective
capacities, the called service could then extract the difference
among the numbers to offer three classes of capacity reservation
for next week's scheduling:

Guaranteed (Priority 1): 15 items
Reserved (Priority 2): 26–15=11 items
Option (Priority 3): 44–26 = 18 items
Now that they had defined the three classes of capacity
reservation service, how did they know when to offer each class?
In a nutshell, David mapped out the dependency scenarios in a
3x3 table, as well as mechanisms in handling each scenario
using the three classes of capacity reservation above and a table
as a reservation system.
Dependency scenario(s) in a 3x3 table

Figure 5.3: Dependency scenario(s) in a 3x3 table Source:
medium.com)
Culture follows values, practices follow the culture. Values must
always lead. Values are something that people think helps them
become better or more transparent
Reservation systems
Let's depict some important pointers on

Figure 5.4: Reservation systems Source: medium.com)
For details, this material is included in the Enterprise Service
Planning class offered by the Kanban University as well as in
the one-day module called Managing Dependencies for Enterprise
Agility in the Agile Pain Point Solutions series offered by David
J. Anderson School of Management.
Key takeaways
Extend the application of classes of service from the service
delivery and option selections to capacity reservation.
Use the historical delivery rate to define different classes of
capacity reservation.

The idea of making multiple classes of reservations at the same
time for one request.
Why we liked Using a deterministic method to manage
dependency does not stick well with me. This session challenged
that notion and provided an alternative to handle the uncertainty
of dependencies and scheduling.

5.2 Scrum key takeaways
Let's see some key pointers on Scrum key takeaways.

5.2.1 Different failure modes of a Scrum team
Let's see some key pointers on failure modes of a Scrum
Failure mode 1: Team does not understand Scrum.
Failure mode 2: Team follows Scrum-but.
Failure mode 3: Command and control of Scrum master or
product owner on the team.
Failure mode 4: External task assignment.
Failure mode 5: Backlog items are too big.
Failure mode 6: Backlog items are not updated
properly/frequently.
Failure mode 7: Poor team self-management.
Failure mode 8: Anti-self-management.

Failure mode 9: Team is too big.
Failure mode 10: Scrum master does not provide leadership.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

5.2.2 Golden field rules of Scrum for a better outcome
Let's see some key pointers on field rules of Scrum for a better
Adoption Mistakes You Must is for people familiar with Agile and
Scrum and have a basic knowledge of Agile and Scrum. To
learn about the Scrum basics, please read the freely
downloadable Scrum Guide, the official Scrum body of
knowledge, by Ken Scwhaber and Jeff
Project delivery is low-hanging fruit. Many organizations receive
some benefit from adopting Agile during the project delivery
phase. However, they fail to leverage Agile across the
organization by focusing just on delivery. The rest of the
organization still operates traditionally, which hampers the Agility
of the organization. With time, even parts of the organization
delivering projects find it difficult to remain Agile. Agile project
delivery becomes an uphill battle. Organizations need to look at
their processes end-to-end and adopt Agile across the
organization instead of just during project delivery.
The Scrum master is not a project manager. The Scrum master
is a servant-leader role. The Scrum master does not assign tasks

or spoon-feed decisions to the team. The Scrum master does
not act as a go-between for the team and the product owner.
The Scrum master helps, coaches and guides the team in
becoming self-organizing.
The Scrum master role is not just about facilitating meetings
and producing reports. The Scrum master is responsible for
removing impediments. The Scrum master ensures that the team
remains highly productive by removing impediments on a
continuous basis. The Scrum master remains alert to potential
conflicts in the team and strives to resolve conflicts at the
earliest.
The product backlog contains all the requirements at a given
time. Updating the product backlog is a continuous process as
new requirements emerge. It is a living document. There should
be clear agreement between the team and the product owner
about the format of the product backlog, and the tools and
version control mechanism, to reduce wasted time in solving the
correct version and format. Only one product backlog is used
for the team. The team must not create separate hidden product
backlogs, instead, it should work with the product owner to
create, maintain, and update the product backlog.
The product backlog is a living document with continuous
updating as the requirements emerge. If the team and the

product owner do not work together to groom the product
backlog every sprint; they risk having a product backlog not
ready to be taken to the sprint planning meeting. It leads to
long sprint planning meetings, wasted work, and missed
opportunities. The team and the product owner should schedule
at least one product backlog grooming session per sprint.
The definition of done provides the team with a litmus test for
the work it produces during the sprint. If the definition of done
is incomplete, the team does not know that it is not getting to
done and the product owner and the team often get "surprised"
at the level of undone work at the end. The definition of done
is not static, and it should be continuously enhanced.
The team should produce potentially shippable increments every
sprint. Many teams struggle to get done increments by the end
of their sprints. They either lack the skills or ignore some work.
They either lack a good definition of done or do not adhere to
it every sprint.
Splitting the project responsibility across its lifecycle is
dangerous. Poor decision making earlier in the project lifecycle
increases the cost later. Cutting corners earlier does not mean
the organization will not be paying for this later. Rather the cost
of cutting corners earlier adds up dramatically. The product
owner is accountable for the return on investment across the

lifecycle. An empowered product owner across the project
lifecycle can mitigate poor decision making about quality and
long-term sustainability.
The Scrum master should help the team understand the value
of daily scrums. The daily Scrum is a meeting for the team. If
members turn up late, the team suffers as a result. The team
should devise a plan to discourage members from turning up
late. Several teams agree on a small fine (and they give the
money to a charitable cause), or another penalty which keeps
members on their toes.
A cross-functional team is a critical factor in getting the
increments to If the team lacks the skills, for one reason or the
other, it cannot complete all the work related to selected items.
Parts of the organization responsible for funding and resourcing
need to understand how Agile and Scrum projects operate, how
requirements and plans emerge, and how do Agile and Scrum
teams self-organize. Organizations need to work with the teams
and Scrum masters to enable the teams in becoming cross-
functional throughout the lifecycle of the project.
The culture of micromanagement runs deep in the organization
culture. Managers, architects, and senior staff members are
accustomed to assigning work to the team members. Many
times, teams lack adequate skills. These factors lead to teams

that struggle to self-organize. The team and the Scrum master
should work together to resist task assignments from outside
the team, and assess the skill gaps in the team and overtime
address this with pairing and the help of the organization.
Heavy upfront planning, architecture and design work are
legacies of traditional processes. Organizations tend to hang on
to upfront planning and design. They hide this work in sprint
zero. Agile projects do plan initially, but they keep their plans
and upfront design work minimal, as in Agile projects
requirements and design emerge as the project moves forward.
In many organizations, the product owner is considered,
mistakenly, a secondary role. They do not appoint product
owners at all or delegate this work to proxies. The product
owner is a critical role and is responsible for maximizing the
return on investment. Without a product owner, companies risk
producing waste, missing market opportunities and losing
competitiveness.
Agile puts emphasis on good planning, but not on plans. The
Agile teams plan, execute and change their plan as they learn
more about the business, technology and the team dynamics.
They refine their plan regularly. However, this does not mean
heavy upfront planning. The Agile teams do plan, but most of
the planning they do is just-in-time planning. Agile and Scrum

teams do sprint planning, they plan their daily work because of
the daily scrums, and they adjust their plans in the light of
sprint review meetings. Often, they do release planning also.
They work with their product owner to devise a release plan and
product roadmaps. Of course, they understand that their plans
will emerge as they move forward and learn more.
Agile discourages heavy upfront design, but it does not
discourage design. Agile provides us with guidelines to help us
make our designs emergent. Teams design their system as part
of their sprint work. They continuously verify their design
assumptions by building increments of functionality, which is
potentially shippable. They keep improving and verifying their
design assumptions, as they add features. This enables their
design to become emergent.
Agile and Scrum do not say that you should not produce any
kind of documentation. There are cases where some sort of
documentation is needed, and this adds value to the overall
development life cycle. The team needs to ask itself, while
producing the documentation, why do we need this piece of
documentation. In addition, what will be the most effective way
of documenting this? Occasionally, a few diagrams will do. In
other cases, documentation that is more detailed might be
required for legal or regulatory reasons. Agile does not prohibit
the team from documentation at all. However, the team should

question the value of producing documentation. If the
documentation adds value, they should proceed with it.
Please amend it as per business needs.

5.2.3 Best practices of retrospective cadence
Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The
important thing is not to stop questioning.
— Albert Einstein
Why we need a retrospective meeting?
The retrospective is usually held right after the sprint demo.
Many teams don't understand the real reason for having a
retrospective at the end of every sprint. But among other Scrum
ceremonies, the retrospective is one of the key ceremonies that
have to be right. Scrum, which is a widely used Agile
framework, demands that you uphold five core values: focus,
courage, openness, commitment, and respect. The fundamental
expectation is that Scrum teams will inspect and adapt while
demonstrating core values as a team. So your retrospective is
the opportunity for the team to reflect on what has happened
and figure out what worked well and what was problematic, and
then take actions accordingly.
Let's have a look at a few best practices that you can adopt in

order to conduct your next retrospective more effectively.
As the Scrum master, set the right tone and environment for a
great The Scrum master reminds the team about the purpose,
Scrum values, and expected output. The retrospective helps you
inspect your current sprint and then adapt and continuously
improve.
Before you jump into the discussion, "check-in" This allows you
to connect with the team. Once you know that someone has a
concern, note it, be flexible, and adjust your course of action.
More importantly, know whether anything is distracting your
team members. Simply ask everyone to check-in by answering
the following two questions:
How are you feeling right now?
Are there any distractions in this meeting?
Remember that your team has introverts and Use brainstorming
techniques to encourage everyone to participate. I mostly use the
following approaches together:
Round-robin The team contributes ideas in turn, feeling free to
"pass" if they have no comments to share in that round. Do

this until everyone gets a chance to contribute. This ensures
that everyone participates.
Pen-and-paper This is a good technique to get introverts to
participate. Team members write their input first and then share
them with the team.
Ask the team members to send pre-meeting Prepare meeting
notes in advance. This will allow the introverts to respond.
During the meeting, run through the notes and use one of the
above brainstorming techniques to invite others to comment.
Discuss what was problematic and provide appropriate Don't try
to fix too many problems within a given sprint. Arrive at a
feasible number. I recommend prioritizing three to five
problematic areas and solving those. To prioritize, use Planning
Poker® while you estimate the effort and then decide the
number of actions to accommodate.
Pay sufficient attention to identifying best practices and what
worked Teams mostly miss doing this exercise. They think a
retrospective is to look at problems only. Not so. Retaining best
practices and what worked well for the team is crucial for
continuous improvement. Again, limit the items you discussed;
identify the best feasible number for your team.

Remember to talk about key statistics that matter to the success
of the For example, my team talks about the following key
statistics at every sprint and compares the measures with the
previous sprint. This is a great way to evaluate whether your
team is continuously improving.
Defect severity index and defect density.
On-time delivery.
Estimated velocity versus actual velocity.
Value proposition: Check whether the project has returned value
to its stakeholders.
Any wastes within the sprint, such as administrative hours and
training-related activities.
Create a smart action This ensures that the team will go back
and act appropriately to adjust. I assure you that if your team
misses this step, the team's continuous improvement will be
zero or, at best, limited. I use the following format for my
teams, and it will probably work for you as well.

Provide Ask how the team felt during the meeting, whether the
meeting was productive and, more importantly, ask for any
improvement areas, and take actions on them.

5.2.4 Tips and traps of Scrum
During the years that I've been working as a Scrum master, I've
seen some typical mistakes that disrupt a Scrum team. They
slow the team down and prevent them from reaching their best
level of performance. Because mistakes don't necessarily surface
at the beginning of a Scrum implementation, they are difficult to
prevent, and sometimes they are even difficult to detect. I keep
this list written down so that I can come back to it occasionally
to make sure that we aren't making these mistakes.

Mistake no. 1: Too many tasks in progress
Imagine this scenario: Your team has just started working with
Scrum, and the number of tasks is increasing exponentially
because of the many different impediments (maybe your
deployment system is not ready, or your stories are still not
mature enough). Because a task cannot be completed, the
developers start a new task or story. You are almost at the end
of the sprint, you realize that most of the stories are in
progress, and you have almost nothing done (according to your
definition of
Now imagine that you continue with the next sprint and the
same situation happens. The only problem is that you now have
new stories and old stories. In my experience, it is at this
moment that the stakeholders become nervous and start
pressuring the team. As soon as the team feels pressure, one of
the reactions is to start taking on more tasks and working in
parallel, all the while thinking that this makes them faster or
more productive.
It is a well-known principle from the Lean philosophical
framework that working on many things at the same time brings
waste into the process. In Scrum, we are looking to prevent

waste by focusing on a constant flow and pace in our delivery.
If your story is not done yet, you continue working on it before
starting a new one. Sometimes, a part of the task involves
waiting. If this is the case, then you can use that time to help
someone else, maybe by pair programming or by testing. One
phrase that is useful to remember comes from the Lean
philosophy: starting and start

Mistake no. 2: Behavior-oriented management
For many years, companies have used behavior-oriented
management to improve their processes. They tried to control
the behavior of their employees by attempting to measure it.
They introduced work clocks to measure how many hours they
dedicate to each task; they even tried to control how much time
each person should spend on breaks.
This is still a challenge, even for Scrum masters. I remember
one developer who took a lot of breaks and who was not really
open to talking with other people. At one point I was
disappointed with him, but then I realized that we were reaching
our goals, the customer was extremely happy, and the team was
working at a constant pace. It took me some time to learn this,
but now we try to concentrate on measuring things that are
important, like customer satisfaction, quality, and, of course, the
goal of the sprint.

Mistake no. 3: Not having a clear goal
This mistake still appears in some of my sprints. After each
sprint, the team should have a main goal. The reason behind it
is that it helps the team by setting a direction. It is really
important, and it is not easy to do. I've seen some goals like
all all five -- which might seem correct, but they are too general
or too restrictive.
The goal should be clear, measurable, testable, and negotiable.
Furthermore, there should be several ways to reach that goal,
and it should give the developers the freedom to think about
alternatives. An example would be: goal is to provide the user
with an alternative method to pay for our

Mistake no. 4: Making decisions for the team
Sometimes the stakeholders or managers want to speed things
up, and they start making decisions without consulting the team
(I've seen this also with Scrum masters). The reason I have
heard most often is that they think that the team will take too
much time to decide, and they can't afford it. The second
reason I hear often is that they see that the team is not
participating and not being proactive.
Any decision that you make on behalf of the team takes the
responsibility away from them. This responsibility helps with
motivation and makes good teams great. You will need to be
patient; a team that makes decisions will need some time, even
more time if they were never given the opportunity to exercise
decision-making previously. Instead of making the decision, you
can focus on helping them reach a consensus (for example,
through workshops).

Mistake no. 5: Focusing only on efficiency
If we have learned anything about industry and machines, it is
that searching for efficiency is important for things like reducing
costs and making more profit. The problem is that in some
environments we might need to sacrifice efficiency for resiliency.
Consider a high-speed road. If we used the whole capacity of
the road, then every single space would be filled with cars. This
would not really deliver the desired results. You need some
space between cars to let them maneuver and travel at higher
speeds. You need to sacrifice what seems to be efficiency to
allow the system to adapt to its needs.
This is also true for development. Your developers need time to
relax, to think, and to learn. They don't need to be busy 100
percent of their time. Give them a little bit of space so that
they can adapt to whatever is happening.

Mistake no. 6: Trying to centralize control
I have seen this in big projects in which there are many teams
that need to coordinate with each other. In those cases, some
managers wanted to have control over everything. They asked for
written reports, attended meetings to ask for status, asked for
time estimation and plans, etc. This might not seem bad in a
small project, but in complex projects, it is almost impossible to
know what is happening everywhere. Understanding the system
as a whole is something that can't be done in that way under a
complex system.
Instead of trying to control the whole project, make sure to
have diverse teams that can self-organize and work on improving
the interaction and communication among themselves.

Mistake no. 7: Missing visualization
There are several online tools on the market that provide nice
visualization of your projects. The mistake comes when we focus
only on that. Having an online tool is good, but the physical
visualization is also important: Scrum boards, calendars,
whiteboards, and diagrams. They let you have quick
conversations with your team and with stakeholders but also
remind you of your goals and past decisions. When I started as
a Scrum master I didn't think it was important, but after some
time, I discovered how useful it is to have visualization in your
room.

Mistake no. 8: No team-building activities
Do you remember when you first introduced Scrum or Agile
inside the company? Maybe you gave some presentations,
prepared a few games, and even prepared some team-building
activities. As time passed, it looked like everything was going
well, and the number of activities was reduced to the point that
you just stopped doing them. It is true that you cannot give a
presentation every day, but in my experience, you should
continue with them. Holding team-building activities once in a
while helps the team stay motivated and increases team spirit.

Mistake no. 9: No environment in which to fail
As you navigate through the sea of continuous improvement,
your team will come up with ideas they never tried before.
Some of those things will work and some will fail. Your team
needs to know that it is ok to fail because this is the way they
learn. This can be done only if you prepare a safe environment
in which to fail. For example, for one of my teams, we used to
put our on a board, and we tested them for one month. If
there was a good result, we continued with it; if not, then we
just took the next one and tried it. It was clear to everyone that
this was the purpose of the meeting.

Mistake no. 10: Forgetting about quality
It happens sometimes that a team forgets about continuously
improving the quality of their deliveries. The team relaxes and
stops thinking about ways to improve. It is important for us to
remind the team as frequently as possible about trying to reach
a higher level of excellence. Practices such as pull requests, pair
programming, unit testing, or integration testing can help the
team to reach new levels of productivity.

5.2.5 Key enablers to build organizational resilience
Let's articulate some important pointers on it:
Choosing the right metaphor
Agility - The ability to move quickly and easily.
Resilience - The capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and
still retain its basic function, structure, and feedback systems.
Choosing the right types of resilience
Operational resilience - Ability to keep core operations going
such as the supply of products and services, financing of
business.
Strategic resilience - Capacity of organization to monitor and
respond to changes in context, and stay relevant to customers.
Personal resilience - Capacity of individual employees and leaders
to withstand difficult circumstances for long periods.

Choosing the right types of mindsets on strategy
Developing and executing a detailed strategic plan.
Coping with the "fog of the future".
Coping with the fog of the future: Active waiting
Build financial strength
Run a tight ship
Be ready to move quickly
Vision can be fuzzy, but priorities need to be clear
Coping with the fog of the future: Scenario planning
Keep calm and test on
Disciplined

Me first
Coping with the fog of the future: Real options
Invest
Don't invest
Transition from bureaucracy to emergence
Emergent structures are more fluid, they enable resources to be
reallocated more quickly.
Bureaucracy creates rigid, internally-focused procedures.
Effective crisis management: Getting the right balance
Follow BCP plan
Rapid initial response from those closest to the problem
Top-down authority for mobilizing a joined-up effort
Transition from formalization to personalization

An emphasis on formal procedures de-personalizes work and
leads people to lose sight of the big picture.
An emphasis on individual accountability means decisions are
made by the person closest to the action.
Transition from efficiency to reliability
Efficiency means taking out buffers and slack resources to keep
costs low.
Reliability means building in redundancy and slack so that the
system can withstand failure.
Transition towards the lean/quality movement by removing waste.

Golden rules
Let's see some important pointers on it:
Organizing and leading require different principles:
Emergent coordination, personalization of decision making,
reliability of operations and meaning-based objectives.
Operating a business in conditions of radical uncertainty creates
new challenges, you need agility and resilience.
Determine where to prioritize?
Horizon one: Now to Summer 2020
Make sure operational resilience is as effective as possible.
Help colleagues with their personal resilience.
Horizon two: Summer 2020- Summer 2021

Work on your strategic resilience
Embed personal and decentralized responsibility
Invest in reliability, duplicate and local sourcing
Develop a pragmatic/realistic point of view on the future
Invest in individual resilience across the whole organization.

5.2.6 Key strategies to beat Covid-19 pandemic and for crisis
management
Did you loose your job or had a huge loos in your business in
this Pandemic time and thinking how to overcome it?
Below are some thought process.
Acknowledge that there is a crisis
Accept responsibility
Take ownership
Don't play the victim
Attack the process, but not the people
Build a fence
Ringfence the good

Focus on the problems
Get emotional and material help, both normative and structural
Use models or archetypes
Case studies
Experience reports
Unlearn and forget ego and build mitigation strategies based on
agility and resilience
Use lessons learnt of previous experience of crisis (institutional
memory)
Use business continuity plan (BCP) rules strictly for work from
home etc.
Patience
Flexibility and adaptability (why, how, what and who)
Have empathy and practice on explicit values

Have freedom from constraints
Transition from VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous)
to VUCAgility
Here Agile mindset is the key
Making the volatility visible by collaborative communication
Transition from uncertainty to unrelenting and nurture it
Make the complex environment to concentrated environment by
using disruptive supply chain management, effective resource
management and transparent efficient communication channels
Defining the ambiguous nature and focus on action-oriented
activities
"A time of crisis is not just a time of anxiety and worry. It gives a
chance, an opportunity, to choose well or to choose badly".
- Arch. Bishop Desmond Tutu
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the

principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

5.2.7 Portfolio/upstream Kanban implementations lessons learnt
Let's articulate some important pointers on it.
Our findings
Let's see:
Silo mentality, politics and blockers
Team level implementations typically tend to be weak
Proto-Kanban/Level 0 maturity mainly focused on visualization
Adherence to WIP limits - Weak, too much work-in-progress
Dependencies (shared services, other teams, specialists or
vendors)
Lack of explicit other policies especially agreements with
stakeholders

Pull was always a toss
Team liquidity
Manual and repetitive work
High demand as the "management" and business continue to
expand demand
Poor "backlog management" practices
Interrupt-driven work leading to high levels of context switching
Overburdening and dissatisfaction returns quickly after initial
"Kanban euphoria".
No real involvement/ownership of the Kanban implementation
Insufficient funding, insufficient training, leading to a lack of
deeper knowledge of Kanban in many teams
Kanban simply being used as a "reporting tool" rather than any
improvement

Kanban is growing as Kanban-but due to resistance in
mindset/culture, lack of leadership involvement
Difficult to propagate downwards and communicate to teams
Complex tooling/automation
Difficult to provide/track progress (information upwards)
PMO challenge – Keeping leadership updated
Steps to be followed
Let's see:
Analyze why you need to raise organizational agility.
Create awareness via workshops or meetings.
Train everyone involved.
Design the board, agree on the governance model, create
common board rules on how to visualize and create effective
pull signals, create dependency board rules.

Plan for continuous improvement.
Keep challenging the status quotation (team external).
Characteristics of successful implementations
Let's see:
A strong (and senior) champion.
Not just one champion – A whole team (significant investment
up front) - A Lean/ Agile COE or task force.
Mid-senior to senior management involvement – Sr. Director/
VP.
Organization-wide focus on Lean/Agile (not just IT/ software).
Reasonably strong portfolio management "culture" – Process/
team.
Use portfolio Kanban as it is easy to visualize, communicate and
track

A top-down approach to driving organizational priorities
A minimum of 3 levels of Kanban – Strategic/planning and
coordination/ execution
Org. level Lean/Agile (more often Lean) initiative
Start from top or bottom
At any point where more detail is needed, decompose to a
lower level Kanban flow
For any workflow, if abstraction is needed, "summarize" to a
higher-level Kanban.
Benefits of portfolio Kanban
Let's see:
Gives an opportunity for the leadership and operational teams to
"engage" or "connect" and get involved.
Provides the leadership with the ability to prioritize and manage
strategic initiatives in a simple manner ("What is the next (set

of) important things to do?").
Gives the leadership a clear insight into how each prioritized
initiative is being executed ("How is this initiative being
executed?")
Provides departmental/business unit leadership with an effective
way to collaborate across functions and discover/ manage
dependencies ("Where are the bottlenecks?").
Gives operational teams proper context for the work they are
doing ("Why am I doing this?")
Portfolio Kanban encourages KMM level 3-5 behavior
Greater buy-in-Greater leadership support to the initiative shown
by middle management and teams.
Alignment of business imperatives to execution, leadership to
teams– Congruence/ business focus.
Clarity and commonality of purpose for greater organizational
good– Deeper understanding/fitness-for-purpose.

More effective start to their implementation with greater clarity
of purpose.
Better understanding and use of the basic principles of the
Kanban method helping them move up the maturity curve and
become less fragile.
Not affected by the departure of one or two individuals who
might have been the initial champions for Kanban.
Key takeaways
Don't underestimate the power of team values. Put more energy
into defining something that all the teams want.
Contextual analysis-Service delivery performance is extremely
contextual. To be meaningful, your data needs to be filtered and
aggregated.
Be realistic and pragmatic when you work with low maturity
teams. Don't set the bar too high.
Transformations can and should be planned. Set the common
shared vision/goal upfront, so you all know what you are aiming
at.

One thing is method and another thing is people. Watch out
continuously for tribal behavior.
Performance must be seen from the customer perspective,
shifting the purpose of teams from executing tasks to satisfying
customer needs.
Service delivery performance is extremely contextual. To be
meaningful, your data needs to be filtered and aggregated.
Visualizing and measuring the interaction between the parts will
bring you far more insights than visualizing and measuring
individual outputs.
Shared understanding and common language across delivery
performance help teams to shape new collective behaviours and
enables leadership to determine the most impactful interventions
they can make.
Set service delivery and operations review at a regular frequency.
Teams should leverage their existing data using statistical and
probabilistic approaches to forecast. Use the Monte Carlo
method as and when required.

Measure flow efficiency (maximizing the utilization of active work
items) and resources efficiency (maximizing the
utilization/productivity of active resources).
Focus on what matters most to your customer:
Find out what customers really want, what are their pain areas
and core goals.
Your lead time (and its predictability).
Your delivery rate (and its predictability).
Your quality (and its predictability).
Where is the value stream of their process? Use the debugging
tool to understand how the system is behaving. Check the
performance flow and improve on it.
What is your service level? How to improve your services?
How the system works? How to shape the team to understand
new explicit policies, WIP limit?

Why do we have the stress level? How much we do that?
Set the baseline by taking a metrics dump data and do
continuous improvement.
Your description may vary, depending on what part of the
principle stands out most for you, but the above are possible
abbreviations.

Which of the following are true about Scrum-ban?
Corey Ladas was the first to coin the term "Scrum-ban".
Scrum-ban is a great solution for teams who need the structure
of Scrum with the flexibility of a flow-based method.
It can be used for teams who are looking to transition from
Scrum to Kanban.
It can be used as a transition point between a less mature and
more mature Agile practice.
Here, work-in-progress limits are not present.
What is the Frequency to submit Scrum-ban metrics "cycle time"

in AMS Project?
Useful at "ready queue in Scrum-ban".
Select the correct answer(s).
Monthly
Weekly
Quarterly
Daily
i-Monthly
In AMS support project it takes 10 man-days to assign a service
request to UAT after the team has started work. It takes 12
man-days to assign a service request to UAT after the service
request gets created in the ticketing tool. Calculate the cycle
time and lead time.
Select the correct answer(s).

Cycle time: 12, Lead time: 10.
Cycle time: 10, Lead time: 12.
Cycle time: 12, Lead time: 12.
Cycle time: 10, Lead time: 10.
Cycle time: 10, Lead time: 22.
Why you should care about "cycle times" in the AMS project
using Scrum-ban?
Select the correct answer(s).
The faster your cycle time, the quicker you can introduce new
features to your end-users.
It is to track their performance in terms of the number of cards
that reach the done column within a set period of time.
Tracking these metrics on a regular frequency will provide teams
with the ability to ensure that the improvements or changes they
are making are creating the right outcomes.

Tracking both the throughput and cycle time for a team on a
monthly basis will help see the trends for that team. If the
average goes up, then let's keep doing what we are doing. If it
goes down, then let's stop doing whatever we introduced, or
figure out what has changed in that period of time.
Being able to provide your business owners some kind of idea
when features will complete helps to manage expectations and
avoid unpleasant surprises later on.
In Scrum-ban, "average cycle time" is getting calculated as____.
Select the correct answer.
Average cycle time = Avg. work-in-progress/Avg. throughput
Average cycle time = Avg. work-in-progress - Avg. throughput
Average cycle time = Avg. work-in-progress + Avg. throughput
Average cycle time = Avg. work-in-progress * Avg. throughput
Average cycle time = Avg. work-in-progress ^ Avg. throughput

Which of the following is true about "cycle time" in Scrum-ban?
Select the correct answer(s).
If WIP goes down, then the cycle time goes down as well.
If WIP goes down, then the cycle time increases.
If "avg. throughput" goes down, then the cycle time increases.
If "avg. throughput" goes down, then the cycle time goes down
as well.
If "avg. throughput" increases, then the cycle time goes down.
Which of the following are true about in Scrum-ban?
Scrum-ban metric is cycle time.
Scrum-ban metric is velocity.
It's a Scrum/Kanban hybrid process framework.

It is not another method whereby administrators, bureaucrats,
and process-centric fanatics can focus everyone's time and
energy on producing reams of printouts and signatures with
nothing to show for it.
FDD is not another set of process volume that will sit on your
shelf, collecting dust and impressing your supervisor, co-workers,
and significant others with your knowledge of another less-than-
useful set of directions for producing systems.
FDD is not an Agile process.
Both a, b and c.

information with the minimum of overhead and disruption for
the developers.
Which of the following statements are TRUE about FDD?
Select the correct answer(s).
It is liked by clients, managers, and developers.
Clients like FDD because they get to see real results early and
progress reports written in terms that they understand.
Managers like FDD because it gives them a complete and

accurate picture of the project progress and status which is the
information they need to steer the project appropriately.
Developers like it because they get to work in small teams on
small iterations and get to use the word finished frequently; they
get to work on something new every few days. It involves them
in analysis, design, and implementation analysis and design are
not dictated by one or two elite analysts or architects.

their managers with the status information they want with the
minimum effort and disruption.
It isn't liked by managers, and developers.
