How to Use This Book
Who Should Read This Book?
This book is for everyone who talks to customers in order to do a better job
of making something for them. With this book’s guidance, you’ll be able to
gather more accurate and more finely nuanced information, whether you’re a
designer who brings insights into the design process, an engineer wanting to
connect with how “real people” do their work, a strategist seeking a better way
of identifying new opportunities, or a marketer who knows the value of data.
Even if you’ve never formally gone out to your users in order to inform your
work, this book will guide you in the process of planning and executing a
successful user research study. This book provides some very detailed best
practices for studying people, and it encourages you to reflect on your own
points of view.
And if you just like to ask questions, there’s plenty of information here for
you, too!
What’s in This Book?
Chapter 1, “The Importance of Interviewing in Design,” sets the stage,
looking at why you learn about users and how interviewing compares
with other methods.
Chapter 2, “A Framework for Interviewing,” defines an approach—a way
of being—for interviewing. All the tactical best practices emerge from this
framework.
Chapter 3, “Getting Ready to Conduct Your Interviews,” describes the steps
to prepare for a user research study, from identifying the problem to finding
participants and preparing your questions.
Chapter 4, “More Than Just Asking Questions,” introduces a range of meth-
ods that can enhance your interviews, including artifacts you prepare and
take with you, activities you ask participants to engage in, or materials you
develop together with them.
Chapter 5, “Key Stages of the Interview,” describes how to manage the roles
of the team in the field, as well as the different stages that most interviews go
through and how to prepare for and respond to those stages.
Chapter 6, “How to Ask Questions,” gets into the details of asking questions,
with positive and negative examples that illustrate how simple word choices
can make a big difference.

Chapter 7, “Documenting the Interview,” reviews how to capture all the data
from interviews, the limitations (and unique strengths) of taking notes, and
the necessity of a proper recording.
Chapter 8, “Optimizing the Interview,” looks at common variations, typical
breakdowns, and how to improve as an interviewer.
Finally, Chapter 9, “Making an Impact with Your Research,” addresses what
happens next: what you do with all that data and how to take the results
back to the rest of the organization.

Frequently
Asked Questions
Why is this even a book? Isn’t this really just talking
to people? I already know how to do that!
To learn something new requires interviewing, not just chatting. Poor inter-
views produce inaccurate information that can take your business in the
wrong direction. Interviewing is a skill that at times can be fundamentally
different than what you do normally in conversation. Great interviewers
leverage their natural style of interacting with people but make deliberate,
specific choices about what to say, when to say it, how to say it, and when to
say nothing. Doing this well is hard and takes years of practice. Chapter 6 is
devoted entirely to techniques for asking questions.
Why would we bother to talk to our users?
We use our products every single day and
know exactly what we need to build.
People who make a product think and talk about it fundamentally differ-
ently than people who don’t. While both groups may use the same product,
their context—understanding, language, expectations, and so on—is com-
pletely different. From a user’s point of view, a Big Mac eaten in Moscow is
hardly the same product as a Big Mac eaten in San Jose, CA. And neither
one is very much like a Big Mac eaten at McDonald’s Hamburger University
in Oak Grove, IL. A strong product vision is important, but understanding
what that vision means when it leaves your bubble is make-or-break stuff. In
Chapter 1, I examine the impact that interviewing has on project teams.
We don’t have time in our development process
to interview our users, so what should we do?
Developing insights about users doesn’t always have to be a milestone in a
product development process. Insights can be an organizational asset that is
assembled quarterly (or whenever) to feed into all aspects of product devel-
opment, marketing, and so on. Once a baseline is established, subsequent
research can enhance and expand that body of knowledge. Within time
constraints, I’m constantly impressed by people I meet who are so hungry
to bring user information into their work that they find ways to do whatever
they can. In Chapter 9, I discuss the trade-offs when time is the constrain-
ing resource.


Frequently Asked Questions
vii
Which team members should interview users?
While more design organizations are staffing a research role, the designated
researchers aren’t the only ones who go out and meet customers. I’ve seen
many times that as companies buy in to the value of research insights, the
researchers shift from struggling for acceptance to being overwhelmed by
demand. It’s not unusual to see them scaling up their own teams, working
with outside partners, and training their colleagues to be better research-
ers themselves. Ultimately, who shouldn’t be interviewing users? There will
always be a range of strengths in interviewing skills; leading research is a
specialized function, but user research is something that everyone can and
should participate in. In most cases, this will exclude functions unrelated
to key aspects of the business, but given the cultural value of understand-
ing the customer, everyone could be involved in consuming the results of
interviewing users, even if they aren’t directly speaking to those users them-
selves. In Chapter 5, I look at how to manage a team composed of seasoned
interviewers and less-savvy colleagues.
We interviewed users and didn’t learn
anything new. How does that happen?
Sometimes it’s perfectly appropriate to validate hypotheses or to confirm
the findings from previous research. But often when stakeholders report
they didn’t hear anything new, that’s a symptom of something else. Were
stakeholders fully involved in planning the research? Did the researchers
develop a rich understanding of what these stakeholders already believed
and what burning questions they had? Not hearing anything new may be a
result of not digging into the research data enough to pull out more nuanced
insights. Finally, if customers are still expressing the same needs they’ve
expressed before, it begs the question, “Why haven’t you done something
about that?” In Chapter 3, I discuss working with stakeholders to establish
project objectives.

Foreword
I was just looking at YouTube in a brave attempt to keep in touch with popu-
lar music, and I found the musician Macklemore doing a hip-hop celebration
of the thrift store. (“Passing up on those moccasins someone else been walk-
ing in.”) Google results indicate that Macklemore is a product of Evergreen
State University in Olympia, Washington. And this is interesting because
Evergreen produces a lot of ferociously creative kids—wild things who care
nothing for our orthodoxy, and still less for our sanctimony.
Now, our curiosity roused, we might well decide to go visit Evergreen Col-
lege, because as William Gibson put it, “The future is already here; it’s just
not very evenly distributed.” Evergreen would be an excellent place to look
for our futures. But it wouldn’t be easy or pleasant. We would struggle to
get a fix on the sheer volcanic invention taking place here. Our sensibilities
would be scandalized. We would feel ourselves at sea.
And that’s where ethnography comes in. It is, hands down, the best method
for making our way through data that is multiple, shifting, and mysterious.
It works brilliantly to help us see how other people see themselves and the
world. Before ethnography, Evergreen is a bewildering place. After ethnogra-
phy, it’s a place we “get.” (Not perfectly. Not comprehensively. But the basics
are there, and the bridge is built.)
And that’s where Steve Portigal comes in. Armed with his method of inter-
viewing, years of experience, a sustained devotion to the hard problems that
our culture throws off (not just at Evergreen State College), and a penetrat-
ing intelligence, Steve could capture much of what we need to know about
Evergreen, and he could do it in a week. And that’s saying something. Steve
is like a Mars Rover. You can fire him into just about any environment, and
he will come back with the fundamentals anatomized and insights that illu-
minate the terrain like flares in a night sky. Using his gift and ethnography,
Steve Portigal can capture virtually any world from the inside out. Now we
can recognize, enter, and participate in it. Now we can innovate for it, speak
to it, serve it.
And if this is all Steve and ethnography can do, well, that would be enough.
But Steve and the method can do something still more miraculous. He can
report not just on exotic worlds like Evergreen, but the worlds we know—the
living room, the boardroom, the not-for-profit, and the design firm. This is
noble work because we think we grasp the world we occupy. How would we
manage otherwise? But, in fact, we negotiate these worlds thanks to a series
of powerful, intricate assumptions. The thing about these assumptions
is that, well, we assume them. This means they are concealed from view.

xiv
Foreword
We can’t see them. We don’t know they are active. We don’t know they’re
there. Ethnography and Steve come in here, too. They are uniquely qualified
to unearth these assumptions, to discover, in the immortal words of
Macklemore, those moccasins we all go walking in.
This is a wonderful book. Steve can teach us how to improve our ability to
penetrate other worlds and examine our assumptions. Ethnography has suf-
fered terribly in the last few years. Lots of people claim to know it, but in fact
the art and science of the method have been badly damaged by charlatans
and snake oil salesmen.
Let’s seize this book as an opportunity to start again. Let Steve Portigal be
our inspired guide.

Introduction
I had my first experience in user research more than 30 years ago, going
on-site to classrooms and homes to see if people of various ages could tell
the difference— blindfolded—between different colors of Smarties candy
(a candy from Canada, where I grew up, that is similar to M&M’s but with
a broader color palette). It turned out that the youngest people, with their
taste buds least affected by age, could tell instantly.1
As a tween, the initial impact of this science fair project was only on my
snacking behavior. Implications for my career arc did not surface until
many years later when I found myself in Silicon Valley with a fresh master’s
degree in HCI. This was an awkward point for me: I had no design portfolio.
I hadn’t conducted any usability tests. I hadn’t created any interfaces. I had
no design process. I had no awareness of how software (or any other product
or service) was produced. All I had was a nascent point-of-view about people
and technology. I was very lucky to end up working in an industrial design
firm that was experimenting with actually talking to users, whether to vali-
date design ideas or to work at the “fuzzy front-end” where innovation could
take place, “left of the idea.”
Even as the company was exploring how to do this sort of work, I was invited
to apprentice in the emergent practice. At first, I was allowed to review vid-
eos but wasn’t sent out on interviews. Then I was sent into the field but only
to hold the camera and observe. Then I was allowed to ask just one or two
questions at the end. And so it went. After a while, I was leading interviews
myself, training other staff, and even lecturing to students and clients.
While it’s tempting for me to be nostalgic about that time period as one
that had a special focus on learning, I don’t think anything has changed for
me. Nowadays, I travel widely to interview users and to teach others how to
interview users. In the past few weeks, I’ve led a number of training work-
shops and interviewed a bunch of fascinating people. (I called home from the
field to report that, once again, “This is the most interesting project I’ve ever
worked on!”) Maybe it’s my researcher nature, but having fresh stories from
the field to share in the workshops and having refined thoughts about how to
interview to take with me into the field is pretty damn wonderful.
My best wish for you is that learning about how you learn about users will
fuel your own passions in some similar measure.

Chapter 1
T
his is a great time for the design researcher. Within user-experience
design, service design, and to a lesser extent, industrial design, user
research has gone from being an outsider activity, to being toler-
ated, to being the norm. Across industry events, conferences, online forums,
school curricula, and professional practice, there’s a tacit agreement that
designing for the user is the preferred way to think about design. As with any
generalization, there are exceptions. Maybe you aren’t feeling the love right
now, but you probably can agree that things are much better than they were
in the past. To design for users, you must begin with a deep understanding
of users. If you don’t already have that understanding, you need to do some
form of user research.
Tip You Are Not Your User
You may be a user, but be careful of being seduced into design-
ing for yourself. Jared Spool calls that “self design” and identifies
the benefits and risks at www.uie.com/brainsparks/2010/07/22/
uietips-self-design/. I think he’s too easy on self design. Lots of
niche companies make the snowboards, outdoor equipment,
and mixing gear that they, as enthusiasts, would want. But some
have trouble expanding their offering in an innovative way, be-
cause they are so caught up in being the user.
Note
Gaining Insight vs. Persuading
the Organization
While doing ethnographic research in Japan, I sat with my
clients while they conducted another study. They brought users
into a facility and showed them the most elegantly designed
forms for printer ink cartridges. They were smooth, teardrop
shapes that were shiny and coated with the color of the ink.
They also showed users the existing ink cartridges: black rect-
angles with text-heavy stickers.
Can you guess what the research revealed? Of course. People
loved the new designs, exclaiming enthusiastically and caress-
ing them. Regardless of methodology, there was no insight to
be gained here. I’ve gone back and forth about whether this
was good research or bad research. It didn’t reveal new infor-
mation, but it provided tangible evidence to persuade some-
one else in the organization. This team’s approach suggests
that there are other issues with their design process, and while
their research might have been the best solution in that situa-
tion, ideally this isn’t the best use of a research study.


The Importance of Interviewing in Design

User Insight in the Design Process
Although there isn’t a clear alignment about how much time and effort to
invest and what approach to use, at least we, as user researchers, share a
common goal: to gather information about users in order to support the
organization when creating products, services, and more.
What I’m calling interviewing is also referred to by other names: user research,
site visits, contextual research, design research, and ethnography, to name a
few. Regardless of nomenclature, these are the key steps in the process:
• Deeply studying people, ideally in their context
• Exploring not only their behaviors but also the meaning behind
those behaviors
• Making sense of the data using inference, interpretation, analysis,
and synthesis
• Using those insights to point toward a design, service, product, or
other solution
We go to visit our users (in their homes, their offices, their cars, their parks,
and so on) most of the time, but not always. When planning a project, we ask
ourselves if it’s more insightful to bring participants in to see our stuff (say,
prototypes we’ve set up in a facility meeting room) than it is for us to go out
and see their stuff. Overall, our objective is to learn something profoundly
new. There are points in the design process where quickly obtained, if shal-
low, information is beneficial, but that’s not what we’re focusing on here.
Note
Is This Ethnography?
If you are interviewing users, are you doing ethnography? I
don’t know. What I do know is that if you refer to your use of
interviewing of people as ethnography, someone will inevitably
tell you that no, you aren’t doing ethnography (you are doing
contextual inquiry, or site visits, or in-depth interviews, and so
on). The term ethnography seems to be particularly conten-
tious for some folks, but...whatever! That’s really their problem,
isn’t it? I’d rather we move on from definition wars and focus
on what it is I’m getting at when I say interviewing—which
means conducting contextual research and analyzing it to
reveal a deep understanding of people that informs design
and business problems.

Chapter 1
Of course, there are varying perspectives on any “best practice.” Everyone
from Henry Ford to Sony to 37 Signals has offered up their reasons not to
incorporate direct customer input into the development process. The sub-
text of those claims is that people in those organizations possess an innate
talent for building stuff that people love. Yet some companies that publicly
make those claims have hired me to interview their users. The insights that
come from studying users not only inform design but also inspire it. Across
organizations, different design cultures have more or less of an appetite for
inspiration or information, although in my experience it’s hard to interview
users without taking away a hearty dose of both.
Sometimes, the stated goal of interviewing users is to uncover their pain
points (often known as needs). Embedded in this mindset is the mistaken
notion that research with users is a sort of scooping activity, where if you
take the effort to leave your office and enter some environment where users
congregate, you’ll be headed home with a heap of fresh needs. People need
an X and Y, so all the designer has to do is include X and Y in their product
and all will be good. What? No one really thinks that, do they? Well, take a
look at Figure 1.1
Microsoft’s ad campaign for Windows 7 implies an unlikely approach to
research, design, and product development. The customer asks for some
feature—in this case, for the OS to use less memory. Microsoft, seemingly
unaware of the need—or opportunity—to optimize the memory footprint,
smacks their corporate forehead as they see the light, sending their engi-
neers scurrying to fulfill this surprising new need.
Without endlessly debating what Microsoft and their ad agency knew and
when they knew it, suffice it to say that this advertisement reinforces this
semi-mythical scooping model of user research.
Figure 1.1
Microsoft’s ad for
Windows 7 suggests
that their approach to
innovation comes from
fulfilling user requests.


The Importance of Interviewing in Design

I’m calling it a semi-mythical model because this is exactly what some teams
do. Although it may be better than nothing, the fact is that a lot of impor-
tant information gets left behind. Insights don’t simply leap out at you. You
need to work hard and dig for them, which takes planning and deliberation.
Further complicating the scooping model is the fact that what the designers
and engineers see as “pain points” aren’t necessarily that painful for people.
The term satisficing, coined by Herbert Simon in 1956 (combining satisfy
and suffice), refers to people’s tolerance—if not overall embracing—of “good
enough” solutions (see Figure 1.2).
Frankly, I discover satisficing in every research project: the unfiled MP3s
sitting on the desktop, ill-fitting food container lids, and tangled, too-short
cables connecting products are all “good enough” examples of satisficing.
In other words, people find the pain of the problem to be less annoying than
the effort to solve it. What you observe as a need may actually be something
that your customer is perfectly tolerant of. Would they like all their food in
tightly sealed containers? Of course. But are they going to make much effort
to accomplish that? Probably not.
Beyond simply gathering data, I believe that interviewing customers is tre-
mendous for driving reframes, which are crucial shifts in perspective that
flip an initial problem on its head. These new frameworks (which come from
rigorous analysis and synthesis of your data) are critical. They can point
the way to significant, previously unrealized possibilities for design and

innovation. Even if innovation (whatever you consider that to be) isn’t your
goal, these frames also help you understand where (and why) your solutions
will likely fail and where they will hopefully succeed. To that end, you can
(and should!) interview users at different points in the development process.
Here are some situations where interviewing can be valuable:
• As a way to identify new opportunities, before you know what could
be designed
• To refine design hypotheses, when you have some ideas about what will
be designed
• To redesign and relaunch existing products and services, when you
have history in the marketplace
note
The Case of the iPod People
Our company began working with a client after they had com-
pleted a quantitative study about where people used iPods.
They had a list of top environments (such as Home, Work, In
the Car, and so on), and they asked us to uncover the unmet
needs that people had in those particular environments. It
turned out that the specific within-environment needs people
had were just not that big a deal, but what people really strug-
gled with was moving between environments, or moving be-
tween contexts: from being alone to being in a social situation,
from being stationary to being mobile, and so on. These were
the real challenges for people. For example, if you’ve worn one
earbud and let the other dangle so you could stay somewhat
engaged, you’ve dealt with this particular issue.
So, we excitedly reported to our client that we had found
the “real” problem for them to solve. We were met with uncom-
fortable silence before they told us that they had committed
organizational resources to addressing the problem as it cur-
rently stood. In our enthusiasm, we had trouble hearing them,
and for a few minutes, the conversation was tense.
Finally, we stated definitively that we had learned some specific
things about the environments, and we saw a rich and complex
opportunity in this new problem. And that was all it took. We
delivered findings about each environment, and then we delved
into the harder problem. It turns out that our client was eager
to innovate, but they just needed to have their initial brief ad-
dressed. It became an important lesson for me: Reframing the
problem extends it; it doesn’t replace the original question.

When to Use Interviewing
There are numerous ways to gather data about users: usability testing, A/B
testing, quantitative surveys, Web analytics, interviewing, focus groups,
and so on. For the closest thing to a “Grand Unified Field Theory of User
Research,” see these examples by Elizabeth B. N. Sanders (see Figure 1.3) and
Steve Mulder (see Figure 1.4). Both do a nice job of creating an organizing
structure around the surfeit of research techniques we are blessed with.

Examples of User Research Approaches
•	 Usability testing: Typically done in a controlled environment
such as a lab, users interact with a product (or a simulation
of a product) and various factors (time to complete a task,
error rate, preference for alternate solutions) are measured.
•	 A/B testing: Comparing the effectiveness of two different ver-
sions of the same design (e.g., advertisement, website landing
page) by launching them both under similar circumstances.
•	 Quantitative survey: A questionnaire, primarily using closed-
ended questions, distributed to a larger sample in order to
obtain statistically significant results.
•	 Web analytics: Measurement and analysis of various data
points obtained from Web servers, tracking cookies, and so
on. Aggregated over a large number of users, Web analytics
can highlight patterns in navigation, user types, the impact
of day and time on usage, and so on.
•	 Focus group: A moderated discussion with 4 to 12
participants in a research facility, often used to explore
preferences (and the reasons for those preferences) among
different solutions.
•	 Central location test: In a market research facility, groups
of 15 to 50 people watch a demo and complete a survey to
measure their grasp of the concept, the appeal of various
features, the desirability of the product, and so on.
Interviewing isn’t the right approach for every problem. Because it favors
depth over sample size, it’s not a source for statistically significant data. Being
semi-structured, each interview will be unique, making it hard to objectively
tally data points across the sample. Although we are typically interviewing
in context, it’s not fully naturalistic. A tool that intercepts and observes users
who visit a website is capturing their actual behavior, but sitting with users
and having them show you how they use a website is an artifice.
Interviews are not good at predicting future behavior, especially future pur-
chase intent or uncovering price expectations. Asking those questions in an
interview will reveal mental models that exist today, which can be insight-
ful, but won’t necessarily be accurate.
But interviewing can be used in combination with other techniques. In a
note earlier in this chapter, I described how a quantitative study helped
focus our contextual interviewing and observations. In other situations,
we’ve used an exploratory interviewing study to identify topics for a global
quantitative segmentation study. We’ve combined a Central Location Test
(where larger groups watched a demo in a single location such as a research


The Importance of Interviewing in Design
9
facility and filled out a survey) with in-home interviews simultaneously and
used the results of both studies to get a deeper understanding of the poten-
tial for the product. It can be valuable to combine a set of approaches and get
the advantages of each.
Is interviewing considered to be user research? Is it market research? Is it
design research? I can’t answer those questions any better than you can! The
answer is: it depends. Whether or not you ally yourself or your methods with
any one of those areas, you can still do great work uncovering new meaning
and bringing it into the organization to drive improvement and growth. At
the end of the day, isn’t that what we care about? I’ll let someone else argue
about the overarching definition matrix.
To Interview Well, One Must Study
Much of the technique of interviewing is based on one of our earliest devel-
opmental skills: asking questions (see Figure 1.5). We all know how to ask
questions, but if we asked questions in interviews the way we ask questions
in typical interactions, we would fall short. In a conversational setting, we
are perhaps striving to talk at least 50 percent of the time, and mostly to talk
about ourselves. But interviewing is not a social conversation. Falling back
on your social defaults is going to get you into trouble!

Chapter 1
Interviewing users involves a special set of skills. It takes work to develop
these skills. The fact that it looks like an everyday act can actually make
it harder to learn how to conduct a good interview because it’s easy to
take false refuge in existing conversational approaches. Developing your
interviewing skills is different than developing a technical skill (say, milk-
shake-machine recalibration) because you would have nothing to fall back
on if learning about milkshake machines. With interviewing, you may need
to learn how to override something you already know. Think of other profes-
sionals who use verbal inquiry to succeed in their work: whether it is police
officers interrogating a suspect or a lawyer cross-examining an opposing
witness or a reference librarian helping a patron, the verbal exchange is a
deliberate, learned specialty that goes beyond what happens in everyday
conversation. For you as an interviewer, it’s the same thing.
The Impact of Interviewing
Interviewing creates a shared experience, often a galvanizing one, for the
product development team (which can include researchers, designers, engi-
neers, marketers, product management, and beyond). In addition to the
information we learn from people and the inspiration we gain from meet-
ing them, there’s a whole other set of transformations we go through. You
might call it empathy—say a more specific understanding of the experience
and emotions of the customer—which might even be as simple as seeing “the
user” or “the customer” as a real live person in all their glorious complexity.
But what happens when people develop empathy for a series of individuals
they might meet in interviews? They experience an increase in their overall
capacity for empathy.1
This evolution in how individual team members view themselves, their
design work, and the world around them starts to drive shifts in the organi-
zational culture (see Figure 1.6). This capacity for empathy is not sufficient
to change a culture, but it is necessary.
More tactically, these enlightened folks are better advocates for customers
and better champions for the findings and implications of what has been
learned in interviews.
The wonderful thing about these impacts is that they come for free (or
nearly). Being deliberate in your efforts to interview users will pay tremen-
dous dividends for your products, as well as the people who produce it.
1	  In http://rfld.me/SzBioQ, William Hamilton Bishop describes a process for interactions
between couples that sounds a lot like many of the best practices for judgment-free listening
that I’ll outline here. He observes that as his clients go through this process, their overall capac-
ity for empathy increases significantly. If we substitute user interviews for the process Bishop
outlines, it’s good evidence that we can expect our own empathy to increase as well.

Summary
It’s become increasingly common, perhaps even required, for companies
to include user research in their design and development process. Among
many different approaches to user research, interviewing (by whatever
name you want to call it) is a deep dive into the lives of customers.
• Interviewing can be used in combination with other techniques,
such as identifying key themes through interviews and then vali-
dating them quantitatively in a subsequent study.
• At a distance, interviewing looks just like the everyday act of talk-
ing to people, but interviewing well is a real skill that takes work
to develop.
• Interviewing can reveal new “frames” or models that flip the prob-
lem on its head. These new ways of looking at the problem are
crucial to identifying new, innovative opportunities.
• Interviewing can be used to help identify what could be designed,
to help refine hypotheses about a possible solution that is being
considered, or to guide the redesign of an existing product that is
already in the marketplace
• Teams who share the experience of meeting their users are enlight-
ened, aligned, and more empathetic.

W
hen Wayne Gretzky apocryphally1 explained his hockey success
as “I don’t skate to where the puck is, I skate to where the puck is
going to be,” he identified a key characteristic of many experts:
the underlying framework that drives everything. This platonically idealized
Gretzky could have revealed any number of tactics such as his grip, or the
way he shifts his weight when he skates. Keith Richards explains his guitar
sound, which involves removing the 6th string, tuning to open G, and using
a particular fretting pattern, as “five strings, three notes, two fingers, and
one asshole.” Even though Keith is explaining the tactics, he’s also revealing
something ineffable about where he’s coming from. The higher-level operat-
ing principles that drive these experts are compelling and illustrative.
Expert researchers also have their own operating principles. In this chapter,
I’ll outline mine, and I hope to inspire you to develop your own interviewing
framework. As you develop, the process evolves from a toolkit for asking ques-
tions into a way of being, and you’ll find that many of the tactical problems to
solve in interviewing are simply no-brainers. As George Clinton sang, “Free
your mind…and your ass will follow.”
Check Your Worldview at the Door
I’ve been asked, “What was the most surprising thing you ever learned while
doing fieldwork?” I scratch my head over that one because I don’t go out into
the field with a very strong point of view. Of course, I’m informed by my own
experiences, my suspicions, and what my clients have told me, but I approach
the interviews with a sense of what I can only call a bland curiosity.
As the researcher, it’s my responsibility to find out what’s going on; I’m not
invested in a particular outcome. Even more (and this is where the blandness
comes from), I’m not fully invested in a specific set of answers. Sure, we’ve
got specific things we want to learn—questions we have to answer in order
to fulfill our brief. But my hunger to learn from my participant is broad, not
specific. I’m curious, but I don’t know yet what I’m curious about. My own
expectations are muted, blunted, and distributed. Although I will absolutely
find the information I’m tasked with uncovering, I also bring a general curi-
osity. Now, the people I work with don’t have the luxury of bland curiosity.
Whether they are marketers, product managers, engineers, or designers (or
even other researchers), they often have their own beliefs about what is going
on with people. This makes sense: if there’s enough organizational momen-
tum to convene a research project, someone has been thinking hard about
the issues and the opportunities, and has come to a point of view.
1	 In fact, it was Walter Gretzky, Wayne’s dad, who said it, as “Go to where the puck is going,
not where it has been,” according to Fast Company’s Consultant Debunking Unit.

The Brain Dump
At the beginning of the project, convene a brain dump (see Figure 2.1). Get
what’s in everyone’s heads out on the table. Whether it’s real-time, face-to-
face, in front of a whiteboard, or asynchronously across offices on a wiki,
talk through assumptions, expectations, closely-held beliefs, perspectives,
and hypotheses. Contradictions are inevitable and should even be encour-
aged. The point is not establishing consensus; it’s to surface what’s implicit.
By saying it aloud and writing it down, the issues leave the group specifically
and enter an external, neutral space.

Capture everything that everyone thinks they know so that it’s not stuck in
their heads.
It’s also not about being right or wrong; I encourage you to anonymize all
the input so that people don’t feel sheepish about expressing themselves.
I wouldn’t even go back and validate the brain dump against the resulting
data. The objective is to shake up what is in your mind and free you to see
new things. Think about it as a transitional ritual of unburdening, like men
emptying their pockets of keys, change, and wallet as soon as they return
home (Figure 2.2).

Tip Work It Out
Chicago’s DD+D (who bill themselves as “a theater-based de-

and other theater techniques, this workshop “helps designers
to check in and acknowledge their own biases and to explore
assumptions before going out and doing research.”2

Make the Interview About the Interview
Another transitional ritual is to make a small declaration to yourself and
your fellow fieldworkers in the moments before you begin an interview. If you
are outside someone’s apartment or entering their workspace, turn to each
other and state what you are there to accomplish. If you were in a movie, you’d
probably growl purposefully “Let’s do this thing.” Sadly, fieldwork is not quite
that glamorous, so you might want to clarify what you mean by “this thing.”
Remember, even if you consider the fieldwork part of a larger corporate initia-
tive to “identify next-gen opportunities for Q3 roadmap,” that’s not where you
should be focusing as you start your interview. Set aside the underlying goals
for the duration of the session. “This thing” might instead be learning about
Paul and how he uses his smartphone or GlobeCorp’s IT department and how
they deploy new routers. It’s important to take that moment to tangibly con-
firm—and affirm—your immediate objective.
Embrace How Other People
See the World
If you’ve effectively purged yourself of your own worldview, you are now a
hollow vessel waiting to be filled with insights. Lovely image, isn’t it? It’s not
quite accurate. You need to not only be ready to hear your participant’s take
on things, but you should also be hungry for it. This willingness to embrace is
an active, deliberate state.
Go Where the People Are
Rather than asking people to come to you to be interviewed, go where they
are. In order to embrace their world, you have to be in their world. Invit-
ing them into your realm (and let’s face it, even if a neutral market research
facility isn’t technically your realm, that’s how your participants will
perceive it) won’t cut it. You’ll benefit by interviewing them in their own
environment—this is the environment you are interested in, where the arti-
facts and behaviors you want to learn about are rooted. By the same token,
you’ll also benefit from your own first-hand experience in that environment.
The information you learn when going into other people’s worlds is different
from what you learn when bringing them into yours.
To that end, try not to bring your world into theirs. Leave the company-logo
clothing (and accessories) at home. Wearing your colors is fine when you’re
rooting for the home team or taking your hog to Sturgis, but it has no place
in the interviewing room (see Figure 2.3).

Be Ready to Ask Questions for Which
You Think You Know the Answer
You already know how you plan a balanced meal, prepare your taxes, or
select an aspect ratio on your HDTV. You may already have an idea about
how your participant does those things (because of what you’ve learned
about them during the screening process, or implied by something they said
earlier in the interview, or assumed by what you’ve seen other people do in
the past). However, you need to be open to asking for details anyway. I’ll have
more to say in subsequent chapters about asking questions, but for now keep
in mind that to embrace their world you need to explore the details of their
world. Some people fear that they are being false by asking a question if they
think they know the answer. But don’t be so confident with your own pre-
sumptions. Interesting tidbits can emerge when you ask these questions, as
this hypothetical example suggests:
Question: When are your taxes due?
The answer (which you already know): April 15


A Framework for Interviewing
19
The response you fear: Why are you asking me this stuff? Everyone
knows that it’s April 15. Get out of my house, jerk face!
The type of answer you are just as likely to get if you swallow your
discomfort and ask the question anyway: I always complete every-
thing by March 1. I think it’s April 15 this year, but I never really pay
attention to that.
The goal here is to make it clear to the participant (and to yourself) that
they are the expert and you are the novice. This definitely pays off. When I
conduct research overseas, people tangibly extend themselves to answer my
necessarily naïve questions. Although it’s most apparent in those extreme
situations, it applies to all interviews. Respect for their expertise coupled
with your own humility serves as a powerful invitation to the participant.
Nip Distractions in the Bud
Tactically, make sure that you are not distracted when you arrive. Take
care of your food, drink, and restroom needs in advance. When I meet up
with colleagues who are coming to the interview from a different location,
we pick an easy location (such as a Starbucks) for a pre-interview briefing.
It gives us time to acclimate into interview mode, review the participant’s
profile, catch up on what’s been happening in the field to date, and address
our personal needs. If your brain is chattering, “Lord, am I famished! When’s
lunch?” you are at a disadvantage when it comes to tuning into what’s going
on in the interview.
Needless to say, silence your mobile phone and don’t plan on taking calls
or checking texts or emails during the interview. I say “needless,” but I met
a team that took a different approach. Sensitive to the commitment their
internal clients were making in leaving the office for fieldwork, they allowed
mobile device usage during the interview, within limits. Although they were
inspired by one colleague who had the stealth-check-below-the-table move
down cold, most people weren’t able to handle it quite so deftly. It was a good
lesson to learn; they won’t be allowing cell phones in the future. Mind you,
even if one were successfully stealthy, that’s beside the point. Figure 2.4 is an
evocative depiction of the multitasking potential of technology, but during
an interview (and probably during a date), you should be fully engaged with
the other person.

Chapter 2
Building Rapport
I often leave an interview with my head slightly swimming, in a state
between energized and exhausted. In addition to all the useful information
that will impact the project, I’ve just made an intense connection with a
new person. I’ve established a rapport with someone. That’s a powerful feel-
ing, and likely as not, my participant is feeling the same way. Our quotidian
transaction to learn about breakfast making has turned into something else.
The rapport is what makes for great interviews. You won’t leave every inter-
view walking on a cloud, but getting to that state with your interviewee is
something to strive for.
It’s your job to develop that rapport over the course of the interview. By all
means, recruit participants who are articulate, outgoing, and eager to be
part of the interview, but remember that creating that connection falls to
you, the interviewer. As in life, you’ll meet some people who you’ll connect
with easily, and others who you’ll have to work hard for. Some of my best
interviews have been with people who are visibly uncomfortable or disinter-
ested at the outset.
Figure 2.4
Just because you can
multitask doesn’t
mean you should.


A Framework for Interviewing
21
Be Selective About Social Graces
Your participants have no framework for “ethnographic interview,” so they
will likely be mapping this experience onto something more familiar like “hav-
ing company” (when being interviewed at home) or “giving a demo” (when
being interviewed about their work). Sometimes when you visit people in their
homes, they will offer you a drink. For years, I resisted taking the drink, trying
to minimize the inconvenience I was causing. I was well intentioned but naïve;
one time I declined a proffered drink and met an ongoing undercurrent of hos-
tility. The drink offer was made again, so I accepted, and suddenly everything
thawed. The issue wasn’t my pursuit or denial of refreshment, it was acknowl-
edging my participant’s social expectations—guests should act like guests.
This experience took place in the U.S.; in other parts of the world (say, Japan),
these rituals are even more inflexible and failure to adhere to them will likely
doom the interview. Be sure that you’re aware of the social expectations in the
country in which you conduct your interviews.
In addition to accepting a drink, allow for some small talk as you get settled. But
don’t dwell on the chitchat, because your participant may find this confusing.
Be Selective When Talking About Yourself
You are bound to hear stories in the field that you strongly identify with,
whether it’s someone’s frustration with a broken part of Windows or their
passion for Pre-Code Hollywood. Although it’s important to connect with
your participant, it’s not the best idea to get there by sharing your common
interest. Remember that the interview isn’t about you. If you also love Pre-
Code Hollywood, you may think “OMG! Another fellow Pre-Code Hollywood
enthusiast!” But you don’t have to say that! Think about when to reveal some-
thing about yourself (and when not to). Putting a “me too!” out there changes
the dynamic of the interview. It may work to develop some rapport in a dif-
ficult situation, or it may imply you are more interested in talking about
yourself than listening to the other person. Although this approach might
work in social settings, where “see how interesting I am!” is a way we estab-
lish our worth in new situations, it can be detrimental in an interview.
You should definitely talk about yourself if doing so gives the other person per-
mission to share something. As an example, early on in my career I was part
of an interview team where my role was to hold the video camera and ask only
a few supporting questions. As our participant was telling us about her fam-
ily and their history, she stopped and looked at both of us and said, “Well, you
know, my family is Jewish.” She was hesitant to continue. I piped up, explain-
ing “My family is Jewish as well.” She said to me, “Well, then you understand.”
She then turned to my colleague and proceeded to explain the specific details
she wanted to convey. I don’t always tell my Jewish interviewees, “Hey, I’m
Jewish, too! I have a menorah, too!” but in this case a small revelation gave the
interviewee permission to move forward with the interview.

Chapter 2
Adventures in Rapport Building
As we rang the doorbell, my colleague and I unconsciously straightened, preparing ourselves
for that all-important first impression, that moment when our research participant would
come to the door and size us up. We waited for a moment, looking at each other as we heard
footsteps, mustering a smile as the inside door opened.
“Hello,” I offered, “Are  you Brian?”
As I began to state the obvious, that we were here for the interview, he grunted, opened the
screen door, and as we took hold, he turned around and walked back into the house. We
glanced at each other and stepped into the foyer. What did we know about Brian? Our recruit-
ing screener told us he was 22, lived with his parents and brother, and was employed part-time.
The rest would be up to us to discover.
It was 7:30 in the morning, and we were taking our shoes off in a strange house. Eventually,
someone beckoned from the kitchen, and we went in. But already we were out of sync. The
kitchen was small, with an L-shaped counter and a small table for dining. Brian’s mother was
at the end of the L, working with bowls and dishes and burners on the stove. Brian’s father was
perched against the counter, while Brian and his younger brother sat at the table. His father
was a small man, while the other three were quite large. The room wasn’t big enough for the six
of us, so we managed to set up for the interview in the only place we could—at the far end of
the counter. We wedged ourselves (one behind the other) on small chairs, pulling our knees in,
our paraphernalia of notepads, documents, video cameras, tapes, batteries, and so on clutched
in close. It wasn’t ideal, but we hoped we could make it work.
The real challenge quickly became clear: Although Brian had agreed to be interviewed, he was
actively disinterested. We had recruited Brian specifically, but here we were with the entire
family. We pressed ahead, explaining our study, and starting in with our planned questions.
Since Brian was the person with whom we had the arrangement, we focused our attention on
him. He responded with one-word answers (which sounded more like grunts) and the occa-
sional glance at his brother, causing them both to giggle.
My colleague and I avoided looking at each other (it may not have been physically possible, given
the tight quarters) for fear of displaying our despair. Sure, we had arranged this interview, but
the cues we were receiving were making it clear the arrangement wasn’t worth much. At this
point, we had already awoken quite early to conduct this interview, so there was no point in giv-
ing up. If they changed their mind explicitly, they’d let us know, and we’d leave. Meanwhile, what
else was there to do but press on? I asked questions with very little response. I tried the brother,
at which point Brian bolted out of the room for a few minutes, without a word. The brother was
only slightly more amenable than Brian, mostly interested in making critical comments about
his parents (to Brian’s great grunting enjoyment), rather than providing any actual information.
Indeed, it appeared that Brian had not informed his parents that we were coming. Although
I directed some of the questioning toward his mom, she reacted with pretty serious hostility,
informing us (in the context of an answer to a question) that they did not welcome strangers


A Framework for Interviewing
23
into their house, and (while she was preparing food) highlighted the intimate nature of food
preparation as a symbol, which was even less open to strangers. The message was very clear.
But again, what could we do? Pressing on until we were specifically asked to leave, under the
explicit agreement we had made, seemed the best approach. We asked our questions, following
up on the information they had shared, listening closely, looking for clarification, offering up
as much space as we could for them to talk, all in trying to build some flow and dialogue.
Even though the message was negative, at least the parents were willing to talk to us. And so
the young men faded out of the conversation, and the interview eventually switched over to
the parents. Two hours later, it turned out that we had completed an excellent interview with
them; they each had great stories about our topic area and revealed a lot of background about
their family, about growing up, about their activities, and even their perspectives on what
made the United States the country it had become. By not giving up, by ignoring our own dis-
comfort, and by being patient in building rapport, a near-failure turned into a triumph.
Indeed, before we left the house, the mother insisted on cooking up some fried bread, fresh and
hot for us. She stated that “No one comes here and doesn’t get food,” thus reiterating the inti-
mate nature of food she had mentioned at the beginning, but this time as a compliment rather
than a warning.
As soon as we left the house, my colleague turned to me and said, “I don’t know how you pulled
that off; I thought we were done for and would have to leave.” I was very pleased with how the
interview turned out, especially because it began so poorly, but there was little magic to it. I
didn’t try to solve the big problem of the complex dynamic we had walked into; I just focused
(especially at first) on the next problem—the immediate challenge of what to say next. I was
certainly keeping the larger goals in mind of how to cover all the areas we were interested in,
but I was focusing my energy as an interviewer on the next point. And by working at it in small
pieces, bit by bit, the dynamic shifted. As interviewers, we had to compartmentalize the social
experience of the event—the extreme discomfort and awkwardness of the early part of the
interview—and stick to our jobs. We didn’t handle the situation that differently than any other
interview, and it served as a testament to our approach—listening, following up (and showing
that we were listening by the way we followed up), building rapport and trust bit by bit, until
there was a great deal of openness and great information.
Looking back on this experience years later, it’s obvious that there are better ways to commu-
nicate with the participants ahead of time to screen out the unwilling. I should have spoken
directly to the person we were visiting before the day of the interview, in order to get that
person-to-person communication started early. But, given the diversity of people, there’s still a
good chance that you’ll end up with someone sometime who isn’t initially comfortable with the
interview process, and it’s your job to make them comfortable. Doing so may make you uncom-
fortable, but with practice, you’ll learn to set aside social dynamics and focus on the question
asking and listening that will make the interview a success. See Chapter 8, “Optimizing the
Interview,” for more on troubleshooting this type of common interview problem.

24
Chapter 2
Work Toward the Tipping Point
There’s often a visceral point in the interview where the exchange shifts from
a back-and-forth of question-and-answer, question-and-answer to a question-
story setup. It’s such a tangible shift in the interview that I feel as if I can
point to it when it happens. Stories are where the richest insights lie, and
your objective is to get to this point in every interview.
The thing about this tipping point is that you don’t know when it’s coming.
So you have to be patient in the question-and-answer part of the interview
because you don’t necessarily know that what you’re doing to build rapport
is getting you anywhere. You have to trust in the process, which is easier
with experience.
Acknowledge That the Interview Is . . . Something Unusual
Although your participants are using “social call” or “vendor meeting” as
their initial framework for their experience with you, it’s not a perfect model.
Strangers don’t typically visit us and take video of us grinding coffee beans.
Falling back on naturalistic observation is disingenuous; it’s not easy for par-
ticipants to pretend you aren’t there and just go on as they would normally. If
we make the generous assumption that people on reality TV shows are in fact
behaving naturally, that is typically due to an extensive amount of time sur-
rounded by cameras, where what is natural shifts to something different. You
won’t have enough time in your interview to accomplish that. Instead, lever-
age the constructed nature of your shared experience. You are empowered
to ask silly-seeming detailed questions about the mundane because you are
joined together in this uncommon interaction. Frame some of your questions
with phrases such as “What I want to learn today is…” as an explicit reminder
that you have different roles in this shared, unnatural experience.
Listening
When you engage in conversation, you’re often thinking about what you
want to say next and listening for the breathing cues that indicate it’s your
turn to speak. As you jockey for your 51% of the conversation space, listening
becomes a limited resource. Although we all like to consider ourselves “good
listeners,” for interviewing you must rely on a very special form of listening
that goes beyond the fundamentals, such as “don’t interrupt.”
Listening is the most effective way you can build rapport. It’s how you
demonstrate tangibly to your participants that what they have to say is
important to you.


A Framework for Interviewing
25
Listen by Asking Questions
In addition to demonstrating listening by what you don’t say, you can also
demonstrate that you are listening by what you do say. The questions you
ask are signifiers that you are listening. Try to construct each question as a
follow-up to a previous answer. If you are following up on something other
than what the participant just said, indicate where your question comes
from. For example, “Earlier, you told us that…” or “I want to go back to some-
thing else you said….” Not only does this help the person know that you’re
looping back, it also indicates that you are really paying attention to what
they are telling you, that you remember it, and that you are interested. If you
are going to change topics, just signal your transitions: “Great. Now I’d like
to move on to a totally different topic.”
Be Aware of Your Body Language
Make and maintain eye contact with your participant. If you find eye contact
personally challenging, take breaks and aim your gaze at their face, their
hands, and items they are showing you. Use your eyes to signal your commit-
ment to the interview. Acknowledge their comments with head nods or simple
“mm-hmm” sounds. Be conscious of your body position. When you are listen-
ing, you should be leaning forward and visibly engaged (see Figure 2.5). When
you aren’t listening, your body tells that story, too (see Figure 2.6).

Good listening body language.

Chapter 2
The listening body language is important because it not only gets you in the
state, or reflects the state that you’re in, but it also very clearly tells the per-
son you’re talking to that you are listening.
If your brain is listening, your body will naturally follow. But it works the
other way, too! Just as therapists and life coaches encourage people to “act
as if,” you can also put your body into a listening posture and your brain will
follow. Consider the example described by Malcolm Gladwell in his article
The Naked Face. He describes the work of psychologists who developed a
coding system for facial expressions. As they identified the muscle groups
and what different combinations signified, they realized that in moving
those muscles, they were inducing the actual feelings. He writes:
Emotion doesn’t just go from the inside out. It goes from the
outside in…In the facial-feedback system, an expression you do
not even know that you have can create an emotion you did not
choose to feel.
Tip Feedback Is Back
If you are recording your interviews on video for later editing,
you may find the “mm-hmm” noises incredibly aggravating. Un-
less you are miking your participants, your affirmations may be
much louder than their responses (see Figure 2.7). For novice
interviewers in particular, it’s still good to let the “mm-hmm”
fly and really work on developing rapport, even if the resulting
video is going to suffer a bit. It’s better to have abrupt audio
changes in the deliverable than fail to achieve the maximum
possible rapport in the interview. As you gain experience
interviewing, learn to silently affirm with facial expressions and
head-nods, and throw in the vocalization only occasionally.

mations can be louder

A Framework for Interviewing
27
Summary
Experts have a set of best practices—tactics, really—that they follow.
But what really makes them expert is that they have a set of operating
principles. This looks more like a framework for how to be, rather than a
list of what to do. You will have your own framework, but mine consists
of the following:
• Check your worldview at the door. When you begin fieldwork, don’t
fixate on what you expect to learn, but rather cultivate your own
general, non-specific curiosity.
• Embrace how other people see the world. Do your fieldwork in their
environments—not in yours. Before you head out to the field, get
the team together and do a cleansing brain dump of all the things
you might possibly expect to see and hear, leaving you open to
what is really waiting for you out there.
• One of the factors that makes for great interviews is the rapport
that you establish between you and your participant. Don’t forget
that it’s up to you to build that rapport. Focus on them and be very
selective about talking about yourself.
• Your job is to listen beyond “Keep your mouth shut and your ears
open.” Your choice of questions and how you ask them demonstrate
that you are listening. Pay attention to how your body language cues
your participant—and you—as to how well you are paying attention.

A
nyone who has ever painted a room knows all too well the amount
of time it takes to prepare before you ever brush a single stroke—
you have to tape off windows and trim, move the furniture, spread
out the drop cloths, and so on. Sometimes I find this preparation tedious
and unrewarding (I wanna see paint on the wall!), but I also know from
experience that all the prep work has a dramatic impact on the quality and
efficiency of the painting process itself. I know you see this coming, but here
it is: Interviewing users requires the same level of prep work. There’s a sig-
nificant amount of preparation involved before you begin asking the users
anything. This may make some teams anxious if they’ve assumed the launch
of a research project means fieldwork tomorrow. But these projects are
by nature vaguely defined. You probably don’t know what you don’t know,
which is why you are using interviews as your research method. The time
spent creating alignment and developing a plan pays off tremendously.
In this chapter, I’ll review the key issues to address when putting together a
study, including who to interview (and where to find them), uncovering spe-
cific goals and defining the technique that will help address those goals, and
refining the basic logistics that will make your time in the field go smoothly.
Establishing Your Objectives
Clarifying the objectives—what you hope to get out of the research—is an
extremely challenging aspect of many engagements. Even though I begin
capturing objectives in the initial conversations with the client, when it’s
only a potential project, the objectives are further clarified while we are
planning the research, executing the study, and even up until the delivery of
results. Sometimes the objectives are not a fit for the approach. Researchers
are often asked to find out how much participants would pay for a product,
often when that product doesn’t yet exist. Reponses to that question will not
be valid, and it’s good to clarify for stakeholders as early as possible the limi-
tations of contextual research (or any research method, for that matter).
At the outset of a project, make the objectives your initial priority. The first
interviews you conduct should be with the stakeholders—these are often
consumers of the research findings who are less likely to be involved in the
day-to-day study. I typically aim for 6–8 stakeholders, although some clients
ask for twice that amount. These are one-on-one conversations either on-site
or on the phone. They run between 30 and 60 minutes and are used to dig


Getting Ready to Conduct Your Interviews
31
deeper into objectives and establish collaboration. You should ask the stake-
holders about:
• History with the organization and the research topic
• Current beliefs about the customer, the user, and the proposed solution
• Organizational or other barriers to be mindful of
• Business objectives for the project and specific questions the research
should answer
• Concerns or uncertainty around the methodology
You should also review other material, such as previous research reports,
existing products, and in-development prototypes.
Even though what you’re learning will undoubtedly inform all of the
activities throughout the project, the immediate output is the research
goals—articulating what you want to learn from the interviews.
On a project that dealt with reviewing products and services online, the
team arrived at five research goals. Here’s one of them:
Structure of Social Network. How is decision-making driven by the struc-
ture of people’s social network (on and offline)?
More specifically:
• What do people’s social networks look like? What tools do they use
and how are their networks structured?
• How do people leverage social networks for shopping and other
kinds of decision-making? Who has influence with them currently?
• Who among their social network (and beyond) are trusted sources
of information for various decisions and purchases (particularly
within the client’s area of business)?
My team created a document that summarized the project as we understood
it at the time, including the agreed-upon methodology and the complete set
of five research goals. I shared this document with our client to ensure that
we were aligned. In most cases, the goals come easily and are not controver-
sial. In rare cases, the goals may be wide-ranging and exceed the planned
scope of investigation. In some cases, the goals are not a good fit for the
approach you are planning. Use this checkpoint to realign, reprioritize, or
expand the work.

When the Seat of Your Pants Is Enough
by Nate Bolt and Cyd Harrel
Nate Bolt is a design research manager at Facebook.
Previously, he was CEO of Bolt | Peters and an adjunct
professor at SVA iXD.
Cyd Harrell is an advisor to Code for America and other
civic projects. She was previously VP of UX Research at
Bolt | Peters.
There are two ways to approach a road trip. At one
extreme, you can just go. At another, you can spend
months planning the whole thing. Which approach will
lead to a deeper exposure to the region you’re traveling in?
It’s certainly open to debate, and the same can be true of
planning user research.
From our time at Bolt | Peters, we’re fans of minimal
preparation for research because it allows for maximum
serendipitous revelations and maximum speed. We fre-
quently do successful interview studies with a single day of
preparation, and that includes plenty of time for lunch. For
start-up clients, we can then complete the research and
generate useful recommendations in one more day. Some
researchers would call this reckless and irresponsible, but
we don’t think so. For us, it’s efficient, realistic, and fun.
An Example: Blurb.com
When our clients at the self-publishing site Blurb.com first approached us a few years ago, they
didn’t have the time or budget for a large UX research project. Yet they needed to understand
why some of their customers were abandoning half-created books and what they could do to
improve the publishing process. We proposed a single day of remote interviews followed by
a directed workshop to generate recommendations, on one condition: their entire core team
had to attend the interviews. This meant we were all in the same conference room at Blurb’s
office with their stakeholders present, but the participant was remote, sharing their screen
and audio using GoToMeeting. Prior to that day, we had a couple of one-hour calls with our key
contacts, and we presented two short documents for their review.
We did not write a facilitator guide in advance, but instead honed it the day of the interviews,
and since we were intercepting people from Blurb.com for the research, half the script was
simply just asking them to continue doing what they set out to do on their own. So our live
recruiting strategy took care of half the planning process.

The study resulted in several actionable recommendations about both the book-creation tool and
how to present it to users, as well as some striking insights into users’ mindsets/mental models.
Several key factors made this study work:
• The entire client team attended. We weren’t doing our interviews in isolation away
from the people with the biggest stake in the project, so we had the right group available
to approve changes if needed. This meant that we could adjust the interview flow on the
fly, even during a session.
• We didn’t write a script, but we did spend our call time getting a solid understand-
ing of the main questions to be answered. With two experienced interviewers on the
project, we had confidence that we could guide an unscripted conversation in such a way
that it answered those questions. (And if those had turned out to be the wrong questions
based on users’ reality, we could have made the shift right away—see previous bullet.)
• We live-recruited study participants using a Web intercept. We were confident that
participants who answered “What did you come to Blurb.com to do today?” with one of
the tasks we were interested in were actually engaged in the task at that moment. With-
out much direction from us, we’d be able to observe interactions that were important to
the study simply by asking them to continue what they had been doing and think aloud.
• We used an observation and recording method that we had a lot of experience with.
While we ran a solid pre-flight check, we didn’t need to do a more extensive proof of con-
cept. We simply used the online meeting tool GoToMeeting to observe users’ screens, and
Mac screen recording software iShowYouHD to record their screens and phone audio.
• We managed client expectations. We made sure our clients knew that findings would
emerge from individual (and possibly very differently triggered) behavioral moments
that would build into consistent themes. We made everyone promise to ignore the self-
reported quotes and focus on behavior. We also didn’t provide percentages, severity
scales, or other pseudo-quantitative outcomes. With the major players in the room all
day, we knew that consensus on observations would be easy.
But why do it this way instead of pushing stakeholders for more time and more preparation?
The easy answer is that many organizations truly don’t have the time or budget required for
full-blown research. We often simply have to work lighter and faster. But there’s also a way that
a script, in itself, can limit your observations, and so can a strict user profile. When we’re work-
ing without a script, we’re not wedded to a strong presumption of how we’ll elicit the answers
we need, and when we don’t have participants scheduled in advance, we’re not wedded to our
original idea of the right participant profile. If, after six enlightening interviews, the team feels
certain findings are solid and decides to recruit someone from an outlying demographic for
extra perspective, that option remains open. Many times, that outside-the-box question or that
slightly off user generates the most important finding in a study. One of the reasons we do this
is that we hate to miss those times.

Chapter 3
Group Therapy
by Julie Norvaisas
Julie Norvaisas is a senior researcher at
LinkedIn. She was previously a researcher
at Portigal Consulting.
The project started innocently enough. At
kick-off, our client presented us with a series
of hypothesized and storyboard-illustrated
consumer needs, along with several early
but well thought-out concepts being built to
address those needs. Our job was to explore
the needs and test the concepts. This seemed
straightforward enough, but internal ten-
sions were revealing themselves, even at
this meeting.
Some folks on the team were focused on gaining a deeper contextual under-
standing of the consumer’s experience in order to validate and deepen their
understanding of their hypothesized consumer needs. This faction had legitimate
questions about their hypotheses (which were not based in formal research) and
were hungry for insights that could create more texture in their understanding,
and inspire further conceptual design. This group was more comfortable with
ambiguity in the research and was open to exploratory techniques.
Another group of strong voices was determined to simply gather reactions to the
early concepts and prototypes they’d developed. This group had a very high degree
of confidence that with their years of experience, they understood the market very
well and had already nailed the consumer needs. These people were committed to
the concepts and interested in specific feedback to prototypes, down to the level
of form factor, mechanical design, materials, interaction, and GUI.
Predictably, the former group was user-experience designers and marketing exec-
utives, and the latter was software and hardware engineers and technologists.
Prior to departing for fieldwork in Minnesota, the team needed to ensure that our
interview guide met the competing objectives of the stakeholders. We also had to
be economical, with only 90 minutes allotted for each interview.

To build consensus, the team met in the only room that happened to be available,
a vacant office. We gathered our chairs in a circle in the otherwise empty room. It
felt much more like a group therapy session than a meeting!
Rather than painstakingly reviewing the interview guide, we asked everyone to
speak about how they felt about it. What were they most excited about? Nervous
about? What questions did they still have? What aspects of the interview guide
made them feel uncertain? What would make them feel better? We went around
in a circle, and we shared. We listened. We acknowledged concerns and addressed
them. We mirrored. We prodded.
The be-sure-to-get-us-context folks needed to know that we were going to gain some
meaningful understanding of users while asking such specific, granular questions
about the concepts. They would not be happy unless we were delving into behavior
and motivations, even while talking about the size of a screen. The test-our-con-
cepts faction required assurances that the early getting-to-know-you portion of the
interview would not serve as a distraction from critical time spent on the concepts.
They stated strongly that we were absolutely not to waste time asking questions
regarding needs and usage that they already knew the answers to.
The therapeutic approach worked wonders to surface and resolve what seemed
like a real impasse. In the end, everyone felt heard, and together we calibrated the
priorities for the interviews. Inclusive conversation established a level of comfort
on the team and a shared understanding of our objectives.
Of course, as is so often delightfully the case, our careful intentions were blown
up in the first interview. Our first participant told stories that touched the team
deeply and immediately had us rethinking the needs and the concept, in the
context of her reality. This effect built through subsequent interviews, ultimately
changing the thinking of all of the members of the team. The prototypes served
more as props to foster discussion about visions of the future than actual artifacts
to be evaluated.
In the end, the concept-oriented members led the team to broaden their percep-
tion of needs and possible solutions. Original concepts were abandoned. The more
reluctant group became the most vocal advocates for a new direction. The fact
that all parties were heard and acknowledged prior to the fieldwork created trust
despite concerns, and allowed us to be open to what was revealed in the field.

Chapter 3
Finding Participants (aka Recruiting)
Finding participants is a crucial part of preparing for fieldwork, yet some
teams treat it very casually, relying on friends and family (an approach that
is sometimes justified with the “guerilla” rhetoric) or even worse, grabbing
barely-screened participants on the street or in a store (this is known as an
“intercept”). On the other hand, some UX teams (such as those at Intuit and
Salesforce.com) have a full-time staff member whose key responsibility is to
manage recruiting.
The first step (sometimes this takes place early on, as you are scoping a proj-
ect) is to identify the key characteristics for your sample. For example:
• Six active users of blogging software (WordPress, LiveJournal, Blogger,
or MovableType) in Chicago, Lisbon, and Tel Aviv
Two have been blogging for two years or more
Two have been using their current platform for less than a year
All between ages of 25 and 55
• Two active blog readers with more than 100 feed subscriptions
A few things to note in this example:
• We’re looking at several parts of a transaction (in this case, blog writers
and blog readers); even if we are designing only one part of the experi-
ence, we can gain a deeper understanding by looking at it from multiple
points of view.
• We have a mix of the specific (the list of blogging platforms) and the
descriptive. (We don’t know yet what makes someone an “active” blog-
ger or reader.)
• Criteria are based more on behavior (“active,” “more than 100”) than
attitude (“dramatic storytellers”).
As with the research goals, these criteria should be shared with the project
team and iterated so that all parties are on the same page. Also, aligning on
these criteria can require “group therapy” (see Julie’s “Group Therapy” side-
bar). When teams ask themselves who their customers are (or could be), this
question surfaces any number of disconnects: hypotheses masquerading as
facts, aspirations, and mass hallucinations. You should resolve those issues
as tactfully as possible.
For example, in a study that focused on online shopping for athletic apparel,
we spent four weeks (of what was supposed to be a six-week project) actively
negotiating, among an ever-increasing set of stakeholders, the basic arche-
types of customers to look at. It was daunting, but essential for having any


Getting Ready to Conduct Your Interviews
37
success further down the road. We were not able to change the underlying
cultural issues that were causing this issue (nor were we trying to), but we
were able to use our expertise in planning and executing these sorts of stud-
ies to help resolve the deadlock. Although these four weeks were exhausting
and frustrating, we did get the team unstuck and moving forward on the
research itself.
Note
Recruiting Is Data
Recruiting draws heavily on the project management skill set,
but keep your researcher’s eye open for surprises. If it’s very
challenging to find the people that you expect (or are expect-
ed) to do research with, that’s data. In one project, the fact that
I couldn’t find anyone with a luxurious yet functional “smart
home” implementation revealed a great deal about how that
client was conceiving of the market.1
From the criteria, I produced a document called a screener (see Figure 3.4).
This is much like a survey that is used to qualify potential participants. It
includes a mix of question types (including yes/no, multiple choice, and open-
ended), and uses responses to direct the flow through the set of questions.
Once you have a finalized screener, you have to find participants. There are
many approaches, depending on whom you are trying to find. Some orga-
nizations have existing customer lists they can pull from (especially for
consumers). Others firms may go to their sales staff or other well-connected
people for introductions. For consumer research, I almost always use an
external market research recruiting agency. They will use our screener and
either their own database or customer lists provided by our clients.
This is a time-consuming process; it always takes a week or more to align
on the recruiting criteria and the finalized screener (on one project, it took
us about four weeks!); a specialized recruiting agency will need about two
weeks to recruit participants.
For more on recruiting, check out Chapter 3 of Bolt/Tulathimutte’s book
called Remote Research. Although their context is different (they are
recruiting, well, remote participants, and we’re recruiting face-to-face par-
ticipants), the general principles certainly apply here.

Tip	 Working with a Recruiting Agency
For participant recruiting, I typically use full-service market
research agencies that have their own focus group facilities.
(Although you won’t be using those facilities in these studies,
their presence is a good indicator.) My best experiences are
with agencies that I can work with closely through the process.
At the outset, they give the screener a close reading, identify
missing elements, and verify what isn’t clear. As the recruiting
process proceeds, they give daily updates (even when they
haven’t found anyone), and they point out any criteria that are
commonly eliminating otherwise good participants, in case we
want to make an adjustment.
Great recruiters will establish an initial rapport with your partic-
ipants and help them feel comfortable and enthusiastic about
the process. They will also support you in creating a comfort-
able schedule, allowing for driving time and rush-hour traffic.
Costs for recruiting will vary, based on the complexity and the
difficulty of the assignment, but for U.S. consumers, you can
expect to pay the recruiter between $150 and $225 each. Note
that this is their fee for finding and scheduling the participant
and is separate from the incentive you pay to the participant
(more on that later).
Creating the Field Guide
The field guide (sometimes called an interview guide or more formally, a
protocol) is a document that details what will happen in the interview (see
Figure 3.5). Creating this detailed plan is an essential preparatory step. The
interviews themselves never happen as you imagine, but having a detailed
plan prepares you to be flexible. It also creates alignment among the team
(as do other planning tools). In situations where you have multiple teams of
people out in the field, this alignment is essential.
To prepare your field guide, start with your research goals and the other
inputs. This is the step where you translate “questions we want answers to”
to “questions we will ask.” Of course, the guide also covers activities, tasks,
logistics, and more.
The general flow of most interview guides is:
• Introduction and participant background
• The main body
• Projection/dream questions
• Wrap up

Be sure to assign durations to the different sections and subsections. Again,
you aren’t necessarily going to stick to the exact duration in the actual inter-
view, but it helps you see if you’ve got enough time to cover everything you
are expecting to cover. I prefer to write most questions as I might ask them
(“Is there a single word that captures the thing you most like about wine?”),
rather than as abstracted topics (“A single word that represents what they
like about wine?”). As I’m writing the field guide, I’m leading a mock inter-
view in my head. Using more detailed, thought-out questions helps me put
together a more realistic plan.
Introduction and Participant Background
In the introduction, you’ll spend just a few minutes getting the interview
under way, handling some logistics, and setting expectations. This section
of the interview guide might contain the following (italicized text indicates
instructions to the interviewer):
• Give out release form and get signature
• Turn on video camera
• Confirm timing: 90 minutes
• Explain who we are and why we are doing this
• There are no wrong answers; this is information that helps us direct our work
• Tell us about your family. Who lives in this house? How long have you
lived here?
The discussion of participant background serves as an icebreaker and also
provides some context for later in the interview.
The Main Body
As the name suggests, this is the bulk of the interview guide (and the inter-
view). You should create subsections for each of the areas you want to
explore (such as configuration, learning about features, downloading new
playlists). The main body should also include the exercises and activities that
you plan to use (such as mapping, card sorting, demonstrations, and reac-
tions to prototypes or other stimuli).
For a study seeking feedback about a prototype home entertainment device,
our main body topics were:
• Revisit concepts
• Map your technology
• Context of use
• Concept discussion

42
Chapter 3
Be deliberate in how you sequence these sections. You can start with the
general and then dive into specifics; you can start with present day and move
backward; you can start with a previous time and move toward the current
state. There’s no universal rule here, so much depends on your topic and how
you are mentally picturing the inquiry. Remember the participant may take
things in a different direction, so don’t sweat too much over this. It’s easy to
revise the overall flow once you’ve completed a couple of the interviews.
Projection/Dream Questions
Near the end of the interview is a great opportunity to ask more audacious
questions. Because you’ve spent all this time with your participants, talking
through a topic in detail, they’ve become engaged with you. You’ve earned
their permission to ask them to go even farther beyond the familiar. Two
questions that work really well here are:
• If we came back in five years to have this conversation again, what
would be different?
• If you could build your ideal experience, what would it be like?
Wrap Up
A typical interview guide concludes with some basic questions and
instructions:
• Did we miss anything? Is there anything you want to tell us?
• Is there anything you want to ask us?
• Thank then and give the incentive.
Shot List
As an appendix to the field guide, list the photos you want to capture (see
Figure 3.6), such as the following:
• Head shot of participant
• Participant and key piece of equipment
• Close-up of key piece of equipment
• Establishing shots, interior (cubicle or living room) and exterior
• Two-shot of interviewer and participant

As with the other preparation tools, share the field guide with your team.
The typical audience for the field guide tends to be broader than for the more
tactical tools like a screener. I also try to help the people reviewing it under-
stand what the field guide is (and what it isn’t) so that they can effectively
help it evolve. I’ve used the following in an explanatory email:
Remember, this is not a script. It reads very linearly, but it’s really
just a tool to prepare to be flexible. Questions don’t get asked in
the order they’re written here, or using this exact language (so it
doesn’t need to be proofread). If you could look at it with an eye
toward calling out anything that we haven’t covered—e.g., “We
need to ask about how they deal with time zones”—or any larger
topic areas that are missing, or anything that seems wildly off
base, that would be the most helpful.

44
Chapter 3
Scheduling Interviews
If you are interviewing professionals about their work, you may need to run
your interviews during (or just before/after) their work hours. If you are
interviewing consumers, you may have to conduct interviews in the evening
or on weekends. In the latter case, it can be helpful to set that expectation
early on with colleagues who will be participating. Remind them that you’re
trying to embrace the participant’s worldview, and they can begin that pro-
cess by adapting their schedule and availability to the participant’s lifestyle,
not the opposite.
When scheduling your fieldwork days, don’t be too ambitious. Although
focus group and usability moderators tend to set up camp in a facility and
run sessions back to back for a full day or more, I think that’s generally a ter-
rible idea and especially when doing fieldwork. Quality work doesn’t come
from being rushed, exhausted, harried, or overwhelmed. Interviewing is
hard work. You need time between sessions to reflect on what you learned,
adjust your approach for the next interview, get to the next interview loca-
tion, find food, and find a bathroom. Although this becomes more dramatic
when you are driving around a metropolitan area interviewing people in
their homes, it’s still true, even when moving around a corporate facility
during a site visit.
Leave time in between your interviews. Don’t pack too many into a day.
Depending on the constraints (Are you on-site? Are you on the road? How
long are the interviews?), two interviews a day is reasonable. The sched-
ule is at least partly informed by participant availability, so you may end
up with an early morning interview, several hours of free time, and then
an evening interview on one day, and then two back-to-back interviews
the next day. That’s fine. Just don’t try to do several days in a row with too
many interviews.
Travel
The same sanity clause applies to travel situations: if you’re travelling locally,
try to schedule your interviews so they are close together geographically.
If you’re working with recruiters, they should take care of this. If you’re
travelling on a plane, allow time for your plane to be late before your first
interview, and avoid having an interview that will run into your head-to-
the-airport window, because that will destroy your ability to be present in
the interview. Even better, keep travel days and interview days separate. If
you are travelling internationally, leave yourself at least a day to adjust to
the time zone differences, and to soak up the local culture, before you dive
into fieldwork.

Participant Releases and
Non-Disclosure Agreements
A release is a good idea. A release is a document that you have your inter-
viewee sign. It clarifies the rights that the interviewee and the interviewer
(and their organization) have. The text of the release may address a number
of issues:
• Consent: Being in the study is voluntary, and the participant can stop
at any time.
• Incentive: The amount of money that will be given, and that the
exchange of money doesn’t mean that the participant is an employee.
• Model release: Images and video will be used without giving the par-
ticipant any rights of approval.
• Non-disclosure: The participant is obligated not to reveal anything
about concepts he may see.
Although there are ethical reasons to use a release, it’s really a legal docu-
ment. If your organization has a legal department, they will likely want to
create this document for you. You should work with them to strike the right
balance between legally efficacious terminology and regular-folks lingo.
In situations where you are not revealing any concepts of artifacts that
might be considered confidential, you may want to streamline the release by
eliminating the non-disclosure agreement (or NDA).
note 	 Release Me
This is the point in the book where I was going to include a
best-in-class example of a release. In the time I spent writing
this book, I corresponded with researchers at many different
corporations and consultancies. Plenty of them are saddled
with a legalese-intense release. For those who had managed to
wrangle something more palatable to their participants, I was
not able to get access to those documents for inclusion here.
My colleagues were all very helpful, but when it came down to
it, they couldn’t get permission to share their release forms.
Now think about this—it’s a document that is given out to
members of the public (research participants). As I stated
earlier in this chapter, even the recruiting process gives you
data, especially when it doesn’t turn out as you expected. To
me, this highlights the (appropriate, necessary) risk aversion

46
Chapter 3
that characterizes a corporate legal department. While sharing
best practices or being identified as a thought leader may be
appealing to a researcher at a leading corporation, that has less
importance than even the remote possibility of legal exposure.
For you, as you craft a release that satisfies the needs of these
different audiences, be aware of where values intersect and
where they don’t. Good luck!
If you work for an agency conducting this research on behalf of a client, the
release may be an agreement between your organization and the participant,
enabling you to keep the study “blind” (which means the participant does not
know the name of the sponsoring organization), which is usually preferable.
However, if you work for an agency and your client is asking for non-disclo-
sure, you will probably want to use the client’s NDA and have that particular
aspect of the agreement be between the participant and the client directly.
Incentives
The right incentive amount depends on where you are doing research and
what you are asking of the participant. If you are using a recruiting agency,
they can advise you on a recommended incentive. Think of the incentive not
as compensation but as an enthusiastically demonstrative thank you. In
professional situations (interviewing people at their workplace), a monetary
incentive given directly to the participant may not be appropriate. It may
be prohibited by the participant’s employer, it may be unethical or at least
awkward if your participant is a customer, and if you are interviewing indi-
viduals within a group (say an emergency room) on an ad hoc basis, it may
be less clear who to incentivize and at what proportion. In those cases, look
for alternatives.
note 	 Be Creative About Incentives
You want a simple and direct way to demonstrate your enthu-
siasm and appreciation. When interviewing credit-default swap
traders in London’s financial district, my client escort would
stop en route at a Starbucks and load up with Venti drinks and
baked goods. Even though we had scheduled appointments, our
appearance on the trading floor was a small celebration. We’ve
brought pizza into hospitals when interviewing respiratory techs
and made charitable donations on behalf of PR firms.

Crafting the Participant Agreement
by Harry Boadwee
Harry Boadwee is the founder of the Boadwee Law Office in Cupertino, California. He focuses
on technology transactions, software, and Internet law.
Participant agreements for user research are simple but necessary in order to protect
the study sponsors. Although a contract can be formed by spoken promises or by a loose
exchange of emails, the best and most common practice is to sign a contract. Participant
agreements must be short, often no longer than a page, so that participants can read and
sign them quickly, without negotiation. Even a document with a short-form title, such as
“Permission” or “Release,” can be a contract.
A typical participant agreement covers two main concerns:
• First, the participant agrees to keep confidential the information disclosed in the
study and make no use of the information beyond participation in the study. Such
information can include, for example, the questions raised in the study, as well as the
details of the product or service being studied. For example, many studies cover early-
stage concepts or unreleased products/services. Study sponsors obviously don’t want
participants to disclose this information to competitors or (even worse) to the public
by blogging or tweeting about it.
• Second, the participant will grant permission to the sponsor to record, reproduce, display,
and distribute the participant’s responses, voice, and likeness without any additional
compensation or royalty. A “likeness” can encompass video, photographs, or even draw-
ings. The study may include some small consideration, such as a T-shirt or gift card for
a token amount. The release is needed in order to prevent legal claims for compensa-
tion under the privacy and publicity laws of many states. These releases often include an
explicit waiver of any right to inspect or approve the materials created in the study.
These types of releases most often cover the sponsor’s internal use only. Because the con-
cepts and products/services in the study often are in an early stage, the sponsor probably
wouldn’t want to use a participant’s statements as a public testimonial. If it did, the spon-
sor would need to obtain a separate testimonial release permitting public display and
distribution of the participant’s responses, voice, and likeness, and if desired, the partici-
pant’s name and address.
Similarly, if the study sponsor wants detailed testing and feedback concerning a product
as used by numerous participants in their homes or offices, the sponsor would use a “beta
evaluation agreement” instead.
Participants less than 18 years old generally do not have the legal right in most states to
form a contract. Instead, a parent or legal guardian should enter into the contract on their
behalf. Participant agreements and the issues that they cover are governed by state law,
which might create different or additional requirements depending on the state.

You can have your recruiting agency deal with the incentives. For a han-
dling fee, they will mail out checks to your participants after interviews are
completed (although you should follow up with them to make sure they act
promptly). However, to convey my enthusiastic appreciation, I really prefer
the immediate gratification of an envelope of cash handed over as the inter-
view concludes. Obviously, think carefully about how much cash you are
carrying and in what situations. Either way, make sure that your partici-
pants know ahead of time when they’ll be getting their incentive.
If you deliver the incentive yourself, you can go beyond a plain envelope
and include a thank-you note as well. Field researchers from a large finan-
cial institution, cognizant that participants are also customers, supplement
their incentives with logo-emblazoned goodies (a reusable grocery bag con-
taining an aluminum water bottle and a reusable lunch bag).

Summary
It takes a lot of preparation—perhaps a surprising amount—to set up
successful field research. I don’t recommend leaping into the field-
work without setting yourself up to be successful. The effort in creating
alignment, developing a plan, and determining the logistics pays off
tremendously in the quality of the experience for you, stakeholders, and
participants and in the value of the insights gathered.
• Agreeing to the objectives for field research is crucial, but is often
challenging. You may all agree that you are going to interview 12
typical users before you are able to agree on what you expect to
learn and how that will inform your business.
• Use the documents you create in planning (research goals,
screener, and interview guide) to align with your team.
• Consider broadly and choose specifically what types of partici-
pants you want. But treat this as a hypothesis and adjust your
approach if necessary.
• Leave time in your project plan to find research participants.
• The field guide is the detailed plan of what you think might happen
in the interview, typically flowing from the details to their mean-
ing. Having that detailed plan empowers you to be flexible when
you actually go into the field.
• When scheduling interviews, leave adequate time between them
for reflection, eating, travel, and the bathroom. Don’t overload your
day—and your poor brain—with too many interviews.
• Use a release that documents the rights and obligations of both the
organization that sponsors the research and the participant.
• Give participants an incentive that conveys your sincere apprecia-
tion of their time.

Chapter 4
A
lthough the title of this book emphasizes interviewing, when you get
down to it, interviewing involves more than just interviewing. Did I
just blow your mind? I bet that I did. But dust yourself off, acknowl-
edge the glory of recursion, and let’s move on! Interviewing is absolutely the
core of the interaction with your participant, but there are other techniques
(or if you prefer, methods; or if you really prefer, methodologies). You should
consider the interview itself as a platform and try to organically integrate a
larger set of techniques.
Showing and Telling
Even when your only technique is asking questions, there are many ways to get
to the information you are seeking. I’ll go further into the types of questions
in Chapter 6, “How to Ask Questions.” The phrasing of the question itself leads
to a variety of techniques. If one of your research objectives is to understand
how people are managing their digital music, you might ask your participants
specifically, “What is your process for updating your playlists?” With that
question, the participant is being asked to verbally summarize a (potentially
detailed) behavior, from memory. This isn’t necessarily a bad approach; it may
be interesting to hear which steps in the process are memorable and which
ones aren’t. It’s also a chance to get some emotional color. (“Oh, it’s easy, all
I do is….”) But it’s not going to be the most accurate information. By asking,
“What is your process for updating your playlists?” we are actually learning
the answers to the (unasked) “How do you feel about the process for updating
playlists?” and “What are the key steps you can recall in the process for updat-
ing playlists?” That information is very important, but it may not be sufficient
to really understand the user’s situation.
Now, a slightly different expression of the question is “Can you show me
how you update your playlists?” Now you’ve staged an activity. In this activ-
ity, you and your participant will move to where the relevant devices are,
and you will be able to observe the specific steps in completing this task. Of
course, you’re also going to gather the emotional context of the process. I sat
with a financial advisor who struggled to navigate his intranet in order to
find some critical data. His lack of success in locating this data was so frus-
trating that he began to laugh. Of course, it wasn’t comical per se, but he felt
that the failures of the system were absolutely ludicrous, and the laughter
clearly revealed his perspective.
Although a topic such as playlist updating may be specific to that partici-
pant’s personal devices and data, in situations where the process is more
general, you may try a slight variation, shifting to a participant-observation
dialogue, such as, “Can you show me how I should prepare coffee?” Instead
of the subject going through her own process, narrating the different steps


More Than Just Asking Questions
53
as she would perform them, your question directs her to explain specifically
each step so that you can perform it, such as, “Now, before you put the filter
in, make sure the water is boiling.” Asking that person to play the teacher
role not only reinforces the idea that she is the expert here, but it also can
make it easier for her to articulate the details you are seeking.
Note
Participant Observation
Participant observation doesn’t mean observation of the par-
ticipant; it means that you observe by participating. I’m typi-
cally using the term participant to refer to the research subject,
but in this approach, you are the participant because you are
participating in the activities you are seeking to understand.
Depending on the activity, you may arrange to be present when it occurs. I
once sat in a family’s kitchen at 7:00 a.m. and watched as they went through
their morning food prep rituals. (Yes, that was very early. The only thing
worse than the feeling of getting up so early to do fieldwork was the look on
our participants’ faces when they opened the door to let me in. Sure, they
agreed to it ahead of time, but I was certainly not their favorite person at
that particular moment.) I didn’t need to ask them to show me how cof-
fee was prepared because I knew ahead of time that this was when coffee
was going to be prepared. In addition to seeing the operation of the coffee
machine, I saw a great deal of context—what other devices were being used,
who else was around, what happened before, and what happened after.
You can also work with your participant to stage the activity you want to
understand. Although you can expect that breakfast will be eaten most days,
you can’t be sure that the IT department will be installing a new router every
day. However, if you bring them a router when you come for your interview,
you’ve created the occasion.
Another approach more suited for unpacking interactions between people
is role-playing how this interaction does (or should) take place. In a proj-
ect where we looked at customer service experiences, a man complained
emphatically but without specificity about the phone service at his local
department store. I asked him what he objected to, or how it could be
different, but he struggled to find anything to tell me beyond his general dis-
satisfaction with the way things were. Instead, I suggested that he act as the
person answering the phone, and I would act as him, and he could show me
how it should work. After describing the exercise, I held an imaginary phone
to my head and said “Ring, ring!” (see Figure 4.1). He answered his imaginary
phone, and we proceeded to model the ideal conversation. Afterward, we
talked about how our version differed from his typical experience.

Shifting the discussion from the conceptual to the tangible (even
when being tangible means being fantastical) is one way to get at
hard-to-uncover information.
Participatory design, a term that sometimes refers to an overall approach to
design, is essentially giving people the tools to show us how they envision a
new design or solution. This can take many forms: I’ve created blank ver-
sions of a mobile device screen and had participants draw the UI, and I’ve
seized the moment when participants starting envisioning a new solution and
helped them to grab whatever was nearby. (One participant grabbed a hard
cover book as a proxy for size and form factor, but then proceeded to gesture
with the book as if it really were this future device.) Designers sometimes get
nervous with participatory design because it implies that users will tell them
what to design, and they’ll be expected to go off and implement it. Of course,
that’s not true at all. Participants may decide their ideal product needs a han-
dle. But we know that really means that they need an easy way to move it from
place to place, and we know that there are dozens of ways to satisfy that need.
My aim with participatory design is to give people a different way to talk about
needs, where the solutions stand as proxies for those needs.

No one of these interrelated techniques is inherently better than the others.
Any of them may be appropriate, depending on what you want to know, what
you’ve already asked, and what is working well between you and your par-
ticipant. You may also want to combine these approaches to look for points
of divergence. For example, if you observe a certain coffee preparation step
that is excluded from the process your participant teaches you, that’s some-
thing you can ask about: “I noticed that when you were making coffee earlier
you waited until the water boiled before you put the filter in. That wasn’t
something you told me to do. Is it an important part of the process?” As with
so many aspects of the work you’re doing, you want to have a broad palette of
approaches that you can bring to bear as circumstances warrant.
Bring the Tools
This section explains a set of techniques that involves using prepared physical
materials to facilitate the interview, including maps, various forms of repre-
senting concepts, organizing and sorting artifacts, and “provocative” images.
Mapping
A map is a tangible representation that shifts the abstract (such as a process,
a set of relationships, or the details of a large physical space) into a concrete
artifact. This artifact provides a focal point for more detailed discussions
and is documentation that can be taken with you at the end of the interview.
In one example, architects and designers mapped out their fairly complex
workflow (indicating software packages, file formats, processes, contribu-
tors, output, and so on) using sticky notes (where each color represented a
certain class of element) on a large piece of butcher paper. In a project for
Nokia Research Center that involved exploring the notion of convergence,
tech-savvy consumers drew a map of their homes and indicated where their
technology was located and how it was connected together (see Figure 4.2).
The interviewer facilitated the process of drawing the map by probing and
prompting. As the map was built, both the participant and the interviewer
developed a shared understanding. As the interview proceeded, the inter-
viewer could continually refer to the information on the map—for example,
by pointing to an element and clarifying “So that would be when you’re over
here, then?” The map became a crucial element in the analysis and synthesis
work after the fieldwork was over, as the interviewer used it to relate perti-
nent details to his colleagues.

56
Chapter 4
Reactions to Concepts
I don’t like to call this “concept testing” because that implies the key to the
approach is to present a solution and have participants evaluate it. What you
present need not represent an actual solution. For example, you often show
concepts that are not viable or otherwise unlikely in order to explore the
edges of factors that influence desirability, usefulness, and so on (see Figure
4.3). What you’re learning is not an evaluation of the concept, but instead a
deeper understanding of the design criteria for a future solution. Although
concepts are the stimuli, you deliberately choose stimuli that contain some
aspect of your hypotheses, ideas, or questions in a tangible form.

on hand.


More Than Just Asking Questions
57
Note
Go Indirectly
As with participatory design, solutions that you show can stand
as proxies for something else. You aren’t asking questions
about their needs (say, their expectations for a device’s size),
but rather you are asking questions about a concept in order
to elicit, among other feedback, their expectations for the
device’s size. This can be quite indirect; the stimuli don’t actu-
ally reveal to the participant what it is that you want to know,
what is feasible, what is planned, or what your hypotheses
are. There’s a difference between what you want to know and
what you ask. Let yourself be creative when developing these
provocative stimuli.
I’ll go to the interview with a set of specific topics I’m looking for feed-
back about, but it’s important to let the participants structure most of
the response themselves. I’ll put the concept in front of them, with what-
ever explanation or demonstration I’ve planned, and then ask them an
open-ended question such as “What do you think?” The topics they choose
themselves are the strongest natural reactions. If they start off raving about
the keyboard but don’t mention the screen until I ask about it, that’s an
important takeaway. It’s my job to make sure I hear about the keyboard, the
screen, and all the other topics of interest, but the concerns and delights that
they express unprompted are critical.
One caution here: depending on your individual role, you may feel a cer-
tain amount of ownership of the concept. But as I urged you in Chapter 2,
“A Framework for Interviewing,” you should have checked your worldview
at the door and be ready to embrace how someone else sees the world. You
should present your concepts neutrally in order to give the participants as
much freedom in their responses as possible. Even if you begin your inter-
view with “We’re here to get your feedback, so don’t worry about hurting our
feelings,” if you bring out a concept by saying, “Here’s something I’ve been
working on…” you’re activating a natural social instinct that will diminish
their comfort in being critical. The disclaimer at the beginning works at a
different (and less effective) level than the cues you give off in the way you
present concepts. Before you go into the field, practice “the reveal” aloud
until you hear yourself sounding neutral (try “Here’s a whole bunch of early
ideas that I was asked to show you” or “I’ll be curious to hear what you think
of this one” or “Our clients are exploring some possible ideas”). I’ve often
found the concepts themselves are sufficiently complex (because of the tech-
nology that’s being used or the domain of work that is being supported) that
I’m not able to present them effectively. In that case, my client will handle
that part of the interview: I’ll introduce the exercise (with the neutral lan-
guage), my client will give a neutral demonstration of the concept, and I will
ask the first open-ended question.

58
Chapter 4
One more caution here: If participants perceive you as having ownership
over the concept, they may turn the interview back on you: “Will this be
backward-compatible?” “How much will it cost?” “Does it have high fructose
corn syrup in the sauce?” Do not answer those questions. This is a terrible
struggle for my clients who always have the answers and would feel so much
more comfortable in the familiar scenario where they are the experts about
this topic. Once again, do not answer those questions. Do the Interviewer
Sidestep and turn the question back to them: “Is that important to you?”
“What would you expect it to be?”
Concept Formats
There is no limit to the manner of concepts you can develop for researching
with users. But it’s important to realize that you are creating these concepts
for that very purpose: showing to users. You’ve probably seen shiny proto-
types that are intended to get investors, retailers, or managers excited. But I
urge clients to represent their ideas in lower, rather than higher, fidelity1. As
a rule of thumb, lower-fidelity prototypes are best for getting reactions ear-
lier in the process (when you are trying to understand the appeal of the idea),
and higher-fidelity prototypes are better for later in the process (when you
want to verify some specific aspect of the implementation). There are always
exceptions. If you are presenting a futuristic concept, you may want to be
very high fidelity in your representation in order to get participants past the
inevitable “Well, what would that actually be like?” questions and into the
area you want to explore.
High fidelity is not an all-encompassing term. There are different dimen-
sions of fidelity—for example, “looks like” versus “works like.” A prototype
that simulates an experience may be high fidelity along one dimension but
not another. Align your concept representation with your research question.
Here are a few formats for presenting concepts:
• Storyboard: An illustration, typically across multiple panels, depict-
ing a scenario. I used storyboards (see Figure 4.4) when working with
MediaMaster, a digital music start-up that was trying to choose among
a number of different directions in their product development.
• Physical mock-up: A representation of a physical product that can be
touched, opened, and so on. The team at Nokia Research Center mocked
up a number of size variations on a mobile device using foam core and
a printout of a screen design (see Figure 4.5, left). Tursiogear, a start-up
company, provided an early manufacturing prototype of an iPod video
case that I showed to consumers in order to help understand the fea-
tures they were expecting (see Figure 4.5, right).

Chapter 4
I’ve even used this physical mock-up approach for non-technology
projects. When studying how people reacted to different messages in
a gas company’s credit card newsletter, I used fairly realistic examples
of this newsletter, complete with a sample credit card statement and
their official envelope. Although most of the newsletter was actual Eng-
lish, the back page had a number of articles with “Greeked” text (lorem
ipsum, and so on). One participant noticed this text and (thinking that
it was Spanish) commented that the inclusion of a second language was
a great idea! It was a good reminder that our assumptions about ele-
ments in a concept are often shattered in the field. In a slightly more
challenging situation, I arrived at the research session to find that my
client, who was not Apple, had echoed (to put it charitably) the iPhone
form factor in a solid model mock-up for a hand-held device. (Their logic
was that they were going to try to mock it up later using an iPhone,
so….) Every participant therefore assumed that the product would be
made by Apple (it wasn’t), and that it would be usable not only around
the home but also could be taken out and used away from the home (it
wouldn’t). I had to adjust for those influencing factors in interpreting
the results of the sessions.
• Wireframe: A simplified version of an on-screen interface. This could
be printed, sketched on paper, or a combination. It could be presented
on a screen (say, a laptop or tablet). It could be a series of screens that
depict a flow with real or simulated interactivity. We showed currency
traders a data-free mock-up of their trading platform to uncover which
elements had to be carried forward into a redesign and which elements
they were receptive to seeing changed. In the previously mentioned
Nokia Research Center project, their team produced an iPad-based
simulation of a mobile device UI (see Figure 4.6) that we used in combi-
nation with a physical mock-up (see Figure 4.5, left).

Improvising with a Wounded Prototype
Working with Hewlett-Packard on research for their DVD/
digital projector, I met up with my client at the Denver airport
a few hours before we were to head out for our first interview.
He was traveling with an engineering breadboard, which is a
working model cobbled together from parts and controls and
stuffed into an electronics case. (This is a “works like” but not a
“looks like.”) Too big to carry on, it came as checked baggage.
Oops. While it was physically intact, my client quickly realized
that the audio no longer worked. In our scant time, we scram-
bled to borrow multi-tools and other weapons of engineering
destruction. The back seat of our rental car became a mobile
bench as he struggled in vain to repair it before fieldwork
commenced. In the end, it was fine, even without sound. We
showed participants how the device played a DVD and pro-
jected the image on their walls. And then we asked them to de-
scribe the qualities of the audio they would expect in order to
match the video experience the prototype delivered. For more
about this project, see www.portigal.com/wp/wp-content/
uploads/2006/03/Steve-Portigal-DUX05-Projective-
Techniques-for-Projection-Technologies.pdf.
Reactions to Other Stuff
Other stimuli can be helpful in probing people’s underlying belief structures,
expectations, or motivations. As with the mapping tools, these stimuli are
an interactive and tangible way to help people express themselves. And as
before, there are endless ways to provoke participants. Here are just a couple:
• Casual card sort: In contrast to the more rigorous card-sorting process
that is used in software design2, this is a way to prompt a discussion
about a large set of items. For one project, I used cards that depicted
a large set of online services (see Figure 4.7). For another project, the
cards illustrated many items that people purchased on a regular basis.
As the cards were spread out, people began to talk about those that
were relevant to them, prompting stories or highlighting areas for
follow-up questions. Some groupings may emerge with this process, and
the cards can be used as a tool for confirming your understanding of
the participant’s mental model, as in “So it sounds like these two cards
would go together because you see these as examples of something you
do for work, but not for your personal use?” Of course, you can create
new cards based on what you hear (bring blank ones!), or you can anno-
tate the cards to reflect what the participant has told you.
2	 You can find a great primer on traditional card sorting at http://rfld.me/R4c3WG.

Figure 4.7
The primary online services that our research participant mentioned,
selected from a larger set.
• Images that resonate: These images can also be cards, or a printed
sheet, or stickers (see Figure 4.8). Whatever the medium, they depict a
large number of images that are meant to evoke an emotional reaction.
Consider stock photos, glamour shots of products, celebrities, histori-
cal images, nature and landscape images, textures, colors, and so on. (A
variation might be to include words in the set as well.) With this large set
of diverse stimuli, you can ask people to pick a few images that address
something you’re interested in. In past projects, I’ve asked people to select
images that evoked their ideal online experience with our client’s brand,
or that represented the way they hoped a new printer could change their
lives. The most insightful part happens when you ask participants why
they picked those images. They’ll tell you—in surprising ways—what it is
about those images that speaks to them and how those characteristics
represent their hopes, aspirations, or ideal solution.

Homework
Often the thing we are most interested in happens in a series of smaller
interactions over a course of days and weeks. In that case, give your partici-
pant a homework assignment. When I wanted to understand how people
would react to a credit card newsletter, I asked participants to save their
postal mail for a few days, without opening it. During our interview, they
narrated their mail sorting process, explaining what they would keep
and what they would trash. When I then showed our prototype newslet-
ter in its envelope, we had a solid context for investigating the meaning of
the newsletter. Similarly, when Beringer was redesigning its Stone Cellars
wine packaging, we asked our participants to save a week’s worth of empty
bottles. Between their unopened wine, the empty bottles, and the sample
bottles we brought with us, we had a wide range of example packages to
look at together.

64
Chapter 4
I also use homework as a way to prime participants about a topic I’m inter-
ested in. In other words, it helps people reach a state where they are more
introspective about something they may not pay attention to otherwise.
I’ve asked people to log when they use their mobile phone, take screen shots
of every intranet search, or document all their banking activities. This cer-
tainly produces all sorts of curious instances, provocative examples, and
weak signals about possible behavior patterns, but this self-documentation
(sometimes called journaling or a diary study) really pays off during a follow-
up interview. Not only do you have an extensive set of examples to discuss,
but you also have a participant who has been thinking about a topic a lot
more than she normally does. (You can see this happen during interviews
as well; I’ll discuss this more in Chapter 5, “Key Stages of the Interview.”)
That reflection will lead to a better conversation. Of course, a primed user is
not in her natural state, so don’t prime if your goal is to understand what’s
already top of mind.
A specific type of priming is used to accelerate the usage of a product. I took
a streaming music server to digital music enthusiasts and asked them to
install it while I watched. At the end of the interview, I left them with a work-
book that contained about two weeks’ worth of assignments, asking them to
explore a different feature or use case. Given that people would be unlikely
to explore a product that thoroughly in two weeks (if ever, especially given
the complexity of this particular product), it was crucial to give people a
structure—and a motivation—to drive their usage. After two weeks, we col-
lected their workbooks and then returned for a follow-up interview.


More Than Just Asking Questions

Summary
Be creative in developing a range of methods for any one project. While
interviewing is at the core, it’s really a platform that can organically
include a larger set of techniques that goes beyond merely asking ques-
tions. For example, you can vary the activities in the session itself, ask
participants to prepare for the interview, or take materials specifically
to facilitate the discussion. You can also do the following:
• Ask for a demonstration of an activity that might not otherwise
take place.
• Observe a behavior or a task as it happens to occur naturally.
• Use a mapping exercise to create a tangible representation of
something abstract that you can refer to repeatedly throughout
the interview (and then take away with you at the end).
• Show provocative concepts at varying levels of fidelity and create
concepts that will generate discussion around the issues at hand
(rather than testing your best guess at the best solution).
• Use images as stimuli to prompt a deeper discussion. When
mounted on cards, they can be sorted, grouped, annotated,
referred to later, and so on.
• Assign homework (for example, take a few pictures, save some arti-
facts, complete a questionnaire, and document a set of activities)
to give you some data before the interview and to prime the par-
ticipant about the interview topics

ost people are at least conversationally familiar with the Kübler-
Ross model of the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargain,
depression, and acceptance. This model describes a consistent
set of elements in a very human experience. At the same time, Kübler-Ross
pointed out that people don’t necessarily experience all those stages or expe-
rience them in that order.
A contrasting model is the beat sheet (see Figure 5.1), a tool for screenwrit-
ers that lays out the necessary sections of a typical three-act screenplay, a
ubiquitous structure for Hollywood films. There are even beat-sheet calcula-
tors that will take the number of pages of a screenplay as input and identify
on what specific pages the different story elements should appear. While
Kübler-Ross is descriptive, beat sheets are predictive. While being predictive
might seem a limitation when making movies, this consistent structure and
the reliance on other tropes is part of what makes movies work: viewers are
being taught the code with every experience.

Key Stages of the Interview

I’ve identified the stages that most interviews go through, and my model is
somewhere between descriptive and predictive. You may notice some or all
of these stages in your interviews, but you can’t anticipate, for example, that
one will (or should!) happen precisely at the 40-minute mark. But each stage
requires specific tactical preparation or responses from you, the interviewer.
Get familiar with the details of the stages, and if you don’t recognize them
while reading, you probably will the next time you are out in the field. As you
gain experience, moving through these stages will become secondhand.
But Wait! Before You Head Out:
Roles for the Field Team
Generally speaking, I find the ideal size for the field team to be two people:
one to lead the interview, and one to back up the other person. In some
cases, it’s important to expose as many people as possible directly to users,
so more people join the sessions. From social psychology, we know that even
the presence of others will influence behavior, so be cautious. Even three
interviewers will shift the power dynamic and make some participants awk-
ward and less open. This is especially true in a home environment and can
be exacerbated depending on the age and gender of the people involved. If
I’m asked to field a team of three, I make sure that everyone is aware of the
trade-off we’re making between more team exposure and less open inter-
views. I’m extremely resistant to anything larger.
A Guide to Participating in Fieldwork
It’s crucial that everyone going into the field understands their roles and that
the two or three people who are meeting participants will act in concert,
performing like a team. Typically, I convene a brief in-person or telephone
meeting where all the potential fieldwork attendees come together to review
some basic rules. I’m not trying to make instant expert interviewers out of
these folks; I’m looking to pass along the minimum information to ensure
these interviews are successful. By handing out the following guide and talk-
ing through it, I am starting a conversation about expectations and roles.
Here is an example of how I might introduce the guide when I’m talking to
my fellow participants:

70
Chapter 5
A Guide to Participating in Fieldwork
Thanks for joining our research team in the field. Your participa-
tion in this part of the process will benefit the overall results of our
collaboration.
Although fieldwork may appear on the surface to be a straightfor-
ward conversation, you will soon see that a lot more is going on. We
don’t expect you to be an expert interviewer, although you’ll find
that you get better with practice. Here are a few tips to help you get
the most out of your experience and help us work better together:
•	 One of us (Portigal Consulting) will be the lead interviewer.
You will be second interviewer. (Kind of like “second chair” on
Law and Order, where this lawyer sits next to the “first chair,”
actively observing and strategizing without conducting any of
the questioning.) The lead interviewer runs the interview. They
also coordinate the participation of the second interviewer.
•	 Stay engaged! Even if you are not asking questions, listen
actively. That means thinking about what you are hearing, mak-
ing eye contact, nodding affirmatively, and taking notes. You
aren’t just a “fly on the wall”; you are participating.
•	 Interviews are different from conversation. We’ll use a relaxed
tone, but we are purposefully guiding the interaction, often
thinking several questions ahead. Although you may not see the
path the lead interviewer is on, as the second interviewer, it’s
important not to interject in a way that can interrupt the flow.
•	 Write down and hold your questions for the appropriate time.
Interviews unfold like the chapters of a book. Your questions
need to stay within those chapters. It’s the job of the lead inter-
viewer to move the interview from one chapter to the next. The
lead interviewer will create opportunities—usually at the ends of
these chapters—for you to ask questions.
•	 We aren’t the experts. The people we are interviewing are the
experts. We want to gather their stories and opinions, and to
hear what they have to say without influencing them. Use their
language and terminology. If they refer to a product, brand, or
feature inaccurately, don’t correct them explicitly or implicitly.
•	 Use open-ended questions. Don’t presume what you think the
answer should be.
Less good: “What are three things you liked about using the bus?”
Good: “Can you tell me about your experience using the bus?”
We don’t know that they liked anything about their experience
on the bus!

Everyone Stays Engaged
Another approach I’ve seen teams take is to assign explicit roles (such as note
taker, photographer, videographer, and so on). I am suspicious this is partly
busy-work, akin to giving a toddler a complex toy to play with so they don’t get
distracted during a long car ride; it is beneficial to distribute those tasks, but
it’s also more well-defined to serve as the photographer than the second inter-
viewer. My preference is to set someone up as an interviewer and then, when
we meet individually before the interview (say, 30 minutes before, at a nearby
café), explore that person’s comfort and interest with any of the various roles.
One executive asked me hesitantly about joining in the fieldwork, promis-
ing that he’d just be there to observe and wouldn’t be involved. But this isn’t
surgery; it’s an engagement with another person. I told him that his partici-
pation was at least welcome, and at best necessary, but his role would be an
active one, even if it was mostly active listening.
There are a number of techniques for managing the second interviewer
and his understandably naive impulse to ask whatever question he thinks
of at the moment he thinks of it. You can provide him with sticky notes to
write his questions on as he thinks of them (so even if the asking is deferred,
at least capturing the question provides some—albeit muted—immedi-
ate gratification). You can set aside a period of time at the end of the entire
interview for his questions (although this may be asking him to “hold it” for
a long period of time, and you may observe some squirming; further, the
questions are perhaps decreasingly relevant as the interview proceeds). You
can set aside a time for him to ask questions within each topic area before
you move along, asking him “Is there anything that we’ve talked about so far
that you’d like to know more about?” I tell my fieldwork attendees that we
can have a brief conversation in front of the participant about any questions
they have; they may want to suggest a topic to me rather than constructing
the question directly themselves, which enables me to pick that question up
or defer it as I choose. (For example, “Steve, I’d love to learn about how Jacob
sends the documents to accounting.”)
Much of this presumes that the fieldwork team is assembled from two
types of people: those who are likely to be reading this book, and those who
wouldn’t even have imagined a book like this existed. Alternatively, if you are
out in the field with a peer, and you’ve had a fair amount of experience, not
only individually but also as a team, you will find a lovely fluidity between
the two of you. Your brain will tell you, based on body language and breath,
when your colleague wants to ask a question. If you are chasing down a bit of
information, don’t turn it over immediately; just make eye contact to let your
partner know you’re getting there, finish the thread you are exploring, and
then give him the “nod” to step in. This can be a wonderful moment, where
instead of feeling like you are managing precocious toddlers, you are instead
gigging with a very tight jam band.

72
Chapter 5
Be clear with yourself whether you are interviewing with a peer or managing
a less-experienced fieldwork attendee. With a peer, your goal is to har-
ness her keen brain and make the interview better. Talk to your peer before
the interview and explore tactically how loose you both want to be. With a
fieldwork attendee, you don’t share a mental model about how the inter-
view might proceed, and so he might be as baffled by your next question as
you would be by his random question. Given that, your goal is to maintain
control over the flow of the interview while facilitating the attendee to have
a successful experience. Engaging him and uncovering his perspective (as
revealed by his questions) is important as well, but I see that placing third.

The soft close
In Chapter 3, “Getting Ready to Conduct Your Interviews,” I described the
general flow of most interview guides. The flow of the guide corresponds
roughly to the stages of the interview.
Crossing the Threshold
The very first few moments of an on-site interview are often characterized
by mild confusion, especially if you are going to someone’s home; less so if
you are arriving at a professional office with a reception area. In general,
your participants aren’t 100 percent clear on what’s expected of them. They
may not have been told, or remember, your name or the organization you
represent, and only know the details of who recruited them to participate.
Before you arrive, figure out what you are going to say. It may be as simple
as “Hi, I’m Steve. I’m here for the interview.” Or “Hi, I’m Steve from _____.
I’m here for the interview.” (These work especially well if your name happens
to be Steve.) Think carefully about what organization name you use. They
may know the recruiting firm’s name (or even the name of the individual
recruiter), but not the name of your company. They may be more familiar
with your product’s name (such as BlackBerry) than your organization’s


Key Stages of the Interview
73
name (such as Research In Motion).2 Identify yourself in a way that they’ll
recognize. Of course, if you’ve personally reached out to the participants by
email or telephone before the interview, this is much simpler.
Whether you are in a home, a workplace, or any other environment, once
you are “in,” social graces matter. Introduce the rest of your fieldwork team
and offer to take off your shoes if you are in someone’s home (but be sure you
don’t have holes in your socks!). As you come in, figure out where you want to
start the session. In an office, it may be a conference room. In a home, it may
be the living room or dining table. Even if the bulk of the interview is going
to take place at a specific location (say, at a computer or in the mail room),
you may want to start off in a more open and front-stage part of the environ-
ment. Your participant won’t know what you need, so be prepared to ask her.
Arrange seating so that you and your fellow interviewer (or interviewers)
are near each other. In order to maximize the engagement among all par-
ties, you want the fieldwork team to be able to maintain eye contact with the
participant, and you want the participant to be able to respond to questions
from either of you without having to turn her head too far (see Figure 5.2).
If need be, ask the participant to sit in a particular spot. The participant
doesn’t know what’s supposed to happen, so by gently taking charge, you can
reassure her and set the tone for the whole interview.
If you’re shooting video, make sure the lighting is appropriate. If your par-
ticipant is sitting in front of a bright light (such as a window), then ask her
to move or close a blind. If the room is too dark, ask about opening window
coverings or turning on lights. If there’s a radio or television on, ask her
to turn it off (as sometimes those can appear more prominently on audio
recordings than you would expect). This isn’t a social visit (as a guest, you
probably wouldn’t ask your friend to move to a different seat), but rather it’s
2	  In January 2013, Research in Motion finally acknowledged how people think of them and
changed their organization’s name to BlackBerry.

rather than forcing her to swivel her head to keep you both in view (R).

Chapter 5
a purposeful, arranged session. If you are offered a drink, feel free to accept
it, as this is the participant’s way of anchoring the session to a familiar sce-
nario. The participant isn’t trained as a professional interviewee so she will,
of course, rely on familiar styles of social interactions. Although it’s fine for
you to accept her social gestures (in some cases, it can be essential, as a fail-
ure to do so can be read as rude; err on the side of taking the offered glass of
water), as the interviewer, you will offer fewer of those gestures yourself.
As you are settling into place and getting your gear unpacked and set up,
ask the participant to sign any non-disclosure and consent agreements. I’ll
often bring it out as quickly as possible and tell the participant “Before we
get started, we’ve just got some paperwork for you.” The key words here are
“Before we get started.” Specifics will vary depending on the study, but in gen-
eral, ethically and legally, the interview shouldn’t start until your participant
has signed whatever forms you’ve planned for. Let the forms do their work:
don’t project your own discomfort onto the participant by over-explaining the
contents of the form. I prefer to hand over a pen and the forms and then sit qui-
etly (or prepare my surroundings) while she reads it over. Defensive nattering
(“Ha, ha, this won’t end up on YouTube”) undercuts the document’s clarity and
raises concerns that the participant might not even have. Start setting up the
video camera or getting your field materials ready rather than watching her.
Sometimes the people who join me in the field will try to fill these initial
moments with small talk that can inadvertently transition into some of the
interview content itself. The participant—without a clear sense of the pro-
cess—may start offering up opinions and details. Agree ahead of time with
your colleagues not to let the small talk turn into questioning before you have
the signed consent, and before you have your video camera (or other record-
ing media) turned on. Otherwise, you’re going to have to ask those questions
again. Small talk is a lovely lubricant, but keep it at small talk—discuss the
weather, or how your day is going, but don’t start asking questions about arti-
facts in the environment or how long she has been doing her job.
Restating Objectives
This is the point at which the interview itself really begins. Thank the par-
ticipant for taking the time to speak with you, and at a high level, tell her
what this is about. This is an early and important chance for you to speak
using her terminology, not yours. Depending on how her participation was
secured, someone may have told her something about why you are doing this
and what is being asked of her. If that someone wasn’t you, you don’t really
know what was said. Even if it was you who spoke with the participant, you
don’t really know what she took away from the conversation.
It’s okay to describe your work as “market research” if that’s the most under-
standable way for her to know what you are doing. The differences between
user research and design research and market research do not matter to her!


Key Stages of the Interview
75
I refer to our process and objectives at a high level: “We’re working for a tech-
nology company, and we’re out talking to a bunch of different people about
how they are using their laptops.”
I sometimes acknowledge the recruiting process explicitly. Depending on
the topic, it may have been very clear to the participant by the end of the
screening interview what it was we were interested in, saying, “You probably
know from the questions that we were asking when you talked with…that
we’re interested in…” or “I don’t know how much you know about what we’re
doing. I know you answered a lot of questions about…”
Let the participant know what to expect by giving a thumbnail outline of
the process: “We’ll take about 90 minutes with you. We’ve got a bunch of
questions to ask to start off, and then later it’d be great if you can show us
the warehouse,” or “Let’s start here with some discussion and then we’ve
got something we’d like to show you and get your feedback.” If they have
any concerns (“I have to stop at 2:15 to go pick up my daughter”), then these
should come up right away, and you can adjust your process, timing, or
clarify your expectations. This has the additional benefit of reminding your
client (who maybe isn’t as prepared as you’d like) what is going to happen.
Engage your participant: “Do you have any questions for us right now?” If
she doesn’t have questions, keep moving, because even though you’ve told
her that you have specific questions for her, a participant may feel that it’s up
to her to somehow start telling what she thinks might address your objec-
tives. You may even want to shut down too many detailed questions (“How
many people are you meeting?” “What company do you work for?”) by defer-
ring those until the end of the interview. In a gentle way, you can use this to
further set the tone for you as the leader of the interview.
Note 	 Adapting at the Outset
Once, in interviews with high-powered fast-talking finance
professionals, I found myself getting through about half of
these first few sentences before they verbally brushed past me
and launched into their complaints about our client’s product
(something we were all well aware of and not at all focused on
for these interviews). Because of the difficulty of access to these
customers (who were basically doing the interview as a favor),
they didn’t seem to have well-managed expectations about our
goals. Eventually, I just turned this part of the interview over to
them, kicking off by asking, “Well, before we start, why do you
think we’re here?” Inevitably, they politely raged about their cur-
rent frustrations until I could interrupt with “Actually, we know
that’s important, but that’s not what we’re hoping to talk about
today.” It was not an orthodox way of starting the conversation,
but given the type of people I was meeting and the context of
their frustration, it was an effective adaptation.

Unstructured Fieldwork
by Julie Peggar
Julie Peggar is an ethnographer,
chief storyteller, and president,
Gaze Ethnographic Consulting, Inc.
I don’t conduct interviews.
In my design-oriented working world, inter-
views form the basis of most research. For me,
this hasn’t always been the case. I come from
a more traditional ethnographic background,
one in which interviewing is merely a by-product of being in a situation, rather
than the primary reason for the visit. When I design a study, I try to avoid formal,
stand-alone interviews as a part of the process. Instead, I ask what phenomenon
we’re trying to understand, where I would have to be to see it in action, and who
the people might be who can get me there. I privilege observing and participat-
ing over asking and telling. A successful field visit is one in which, at the end,
the participant feels like they’ve made a new friend rather than like they’ve just
been interviewed.
When I first meet participants, they are often curious about what I do, who I am
as a person, and why I’m so interested in the mundane details of hanging out with
them while they do the dishes or pick up their kids. In the field, I don’t put on a
“working personality.” I’m just me, getting to know them and letting them get to
know me back. This give and take helps me blend into the environment more natu-
rally, learning how they would introduce someone new into the family, business,
or activity. The process of getting to know one another gives me critical informa-
tion about the culture and context within which my topic exists. I know I’ve done
my job building rapport when we’ve been talking for half an hour and someone
says, “I should shut up and stop asking you questions so you can start.” We’ve

already started. Their interest in my world tells me about theirs. Everything is
data to me, not just specific questions about specific objects or actions.
Although I have general areas of inquiry that I know I’d like to cover, I don’t put
limits on my time with the participant or on what we do in the time that I’m there.
I’ve never spent less than an hour and a half on a visit, and my longest single visit
(so far!) was 16 hours, although I’ve been based in field sites for months at a time.
I allow what we cover to emerge from the day’s activities, and my questions are
firmly based in what I see them do or hear them say in context rather than on pre-
existing ideas about what might arise. In practice, this works much better than
it sounds! If a participant gets a phone call in the middle of a formal two-hour
interview about GPS units, asking him to leave immediately and drive from San
Francisco to Los Angeles that night, would he ask the interviewer to come with
him? As an interviewer, would you go? What if instead of an interviewer, there was
someone just hanging out and spending the day with you, who has as much time
as it takes for you to teach them about your GPS unit? Would you ask then?
My research assistant and I were hanging out in San Francisco with a comic,
learning how he uses his GPS to get to new venues. At some point during the eve-
ning, he got a call about a booking in Los Angeles for the next afternoon that he
really wanted to do, even though he had to be back in San Francisco that same
night. He asked if we wanted to come along...so we stayed with him. We drove
down to Los Angeles with him that night in the pouring rain, in his beat-up car
with no heater, and windshield wipers that didn’t work, and his bright, shiny,
new, expensive GPS on the dash! Then we went to his show the next afternoon
and drove back home with him that evening. We certainly got a great idea of what
his life is like, about his purchasing decisions and priorities, about the pros and
cons involved in using the GPS on a long road trip that included both known and
unknown roads, and about how the GPS fit into the overall picture. This was a lot
of data that we would have missed out on with a more formal design.

78
Chapter 5
Kick-Off Question
This is another transitional moment as you move into the body of the inter-
view and begin to actively inhabit the role of the question-asker. Your intro
words—“So, to start”—help move things forward, past small talk and logis-
tics. The first question is usually a simple broad one to set some context.
“Maybe introduce yourself and tell us about what your job is here?” It doesn’t
matter too much what it is, as you are going to follow up with many more
specific questions. The key here is not to start too specifically (“Ahem. Ques-
tion 1. What are the top features you desire in your mobile device?”), but to
be mindful of shifting into the mode of asking questions.
Accept the Awkwardness
As you proceed through your questions, you may encounter some resistance.
Although many people (especially those likely to agree to participate) will be
extroverted and comfortable, some people will be uncomfortable. There’s no
formula for how long it takes people to get past discomfort. Some people will
get there with you in a few minutes, whereas others may take an hour. Some-
times (rarely, in my experience), they’ll never reach that point. This discomfort
presents itself in subtle ways; rather than frowns and squirming, you may
observe stiff posture and clipped deliberate responses. They may fend off your
questions (while seemingly answering them) by implying that those are not
normal things to be asking about, or providing little or no detail about them-
selves, describing their behavior as “you know, just regular.”
You may have to identify your own feelings of discomfort to know when
you’re in this stage. If you feel like you don’t have permission to keep going,
or that this person doesn’t really want you there, you are in this stage. First,
you have to accept this as awkward. It’s not the worst thing in the world to
be conversing with someone and feeling ill at ease. You aren’t in physical
peril; it’s just an inner feeling. Let it happen, but don’t let it define you. Lis-
ten to the feeling and set it aside. Now give your participant plenty of ways
to succeed. Ask her easy questions, keeping the inquiry factual, straightfor-
ward, and simple. This isn’t the time to ask challenging questions or to bring
out props or stimuli. Be patient and keep asking questions and keep accept-
ing, acknowledging, and appreciating her responses. Your own comfort (or
discomfort) will come through and contribute to the tone. If you’re follow-
ing your field guide linearly, you may get a good portion of the way through
in a short time and begin to feel some panic about the amount of questions
you’ve come with. Just stick with it; the remaining questions will take longer
to get through (and will generate more follow-up questions, too).


Key Stages of the Interview
79
The Tipping Point
Although I can’t predict when it will happen, there’s often a point when
the participant shifts from giving short answers to telling stories (see
Figure 5.4). Whether or not it’s an actual moment where the answers get
longer, there is a point where you realize that you’ve arrived at a high level
of rapport and the tenor of the exchange is different. In all likelihood, by
the time you have that realization, you’ve probably been crossing back and
forth between short answers and stories. Even if you do notice more short
answers, you are on your way, so just stick with what you’ve been doing.

You can see where this

answers into stories.

Chapter 5
Reflection and Projection
The deepest rapport comes when the participant has spent enough time
immersed in the topic in a supportive and exploratory fashion. By this time,
you’ve presumably captured many of the details around process, behav-
iors, usage, and so on, and are ready to move into the higher-level part of
the inquiry. Now your participant is thinking about the big picture. Her
responses drift into sweeping statements about herself, her goals, her
dreams, her past, the future, our society, and so on. This is the type of thing
that varies across cultures. Anecdotally, I suspect this may be a more Ameri-
can characteristic than, say, British. This can be the most fun part of the
interview; it’s certainly the most inspiring. You are now fully drawn into her
world, and she is painting a detailed picture of what lies beneath or what
lies beyond.
Just because people are speaking about a future (say, how mobile phones
will change their relationships) doesn’t mean it’s an accurate prediction.
That’s not the point of the question; it’s what these predictions and reflec-
tions reveal. These parts of the interview often produce phrases or ideas that
the field team will continue to repeat and go back to as they distill complex
issues into visionary notions.
The Soft Close
Assuming that your participant isn’t running off to another appointment,
the winding-down of the interview can be a soft process. Your hard cues
(thanking her, handing her the incentive, packing up your stuff, standing
up) may not mean she is going to stop talking. Physicians and therapists
are familiar with the “doorknob phenomenon,” where crucial information
is revealed just as the patient is about to depart. So consider keeping your
recording device on, even if it’s packed up. Even as you are heading to the
door, the interview may resume, at the participant’s initiation. Or you may
see something in the environment to ask about. Keep your eyes and brain in
interview mode until you are fully departed. Even if you are tired and ready
to leave, stifle the inner “Oh, there’s nothing here” voice that wants you to
pull the plug. Stick with it a couple of minutes more. Those may be the bits
of recorded data that pull the whole project together for you in the analysis
phase. You don’t know at this point!

Summary
Although interviews are all wonderfully unique, they tend to follow a
consistent pattern. Each stage requires specific tactical preparation or
responses from you, the interviewer. With experience, moving through
the different stages will become second nature.
• When you first come in, set up your seating so the participant can
easily maintain eye contact with all interviewers. Use just enough
small talk but don’t get bogged down in chat. If you are offered a
drink, feel free to accept it.
• If you are joined by colleagues or clients who aren’t skilled at
interviewing, manage their participation by giving them tasks
(for example, photographing the interview) or by briefing them
on when to ask questions and what kind of questions they should
be asking.
• Start with a general, easy question (such as asking the participant
to introduce herself). Ideally,  the rest of the interview just flows
from there as follow-up questions.
• If your participant exhibits discomfort, you can choose whether or
not you feel discomfort yourself in response. If you feel uncomfort-
able, you should find a way to accept that feeling as just a feeling
and move forward.
• People will respond with short answers at first and will eventually
reach a point where they are telling stories. You can’t predict how
long it will take to reach that point, but that is the goal.
• Remember the “doorknob phenomenon,” where people suddenly
open up as the session ends. Try to keep recording until you’re out
the door.

S
o there you are in “the field,” that coolest of phrases that means that
today your assignment is to talk with a stranger in her kitchen, main-
tenance shed, copy center, or other unlikely environment. As you get
down to business, your printed copy of the field guide is gripped tightly
in your sweaty paw. All your objective-setting, question-wordsmithing,
and other planning is captured in 11-point type on these precious four
sheets of paper.
Now, set it aside.
Leading the interview successfully comes down to you. Go ahead and refer
to the field guide as you need to, but don’t let it run the interview. It’s not a
script; it’s only for reference purposes. If you get stuck about where to go next,
that’s when you pull it out and scan through the pages. Despite your plan-
ning, the interview probably won’t unfold the way you anticipated. If it does,
perhaps you aren’t leveraging the opportunities that arise. If you’re a novice
interviewer, you’ll probably lean more toward the guide than improvisation.
Similarly, if you’re at the very beginning of a study, you should rely more on the
guide than you will once you’ve learned from a couple of interviews.
Tip Hold onto Your Loose-leaf
Keep your field guide in a portfolio, a folder, a sheaf of papers,
a notebook, or something else. You’ll be better off if the guide
appears to be put away when you aren’t using it. Early on I did
an interview with the field guide held out in front of me as my
only bit of “business.” At one point, my participant snatched
it from my hands and said, “Okay, what else do you wanna
know?” Although this is unlikely to happen often, it served as a
good lesson for me to tote my paraphernalia in a more profes-
sional (and protected) manner.
Silence Defeats Awkwardness
After you ask a question, be silent. This is tricky; you are speaking with
someone you’ve never spoken to before. You are learning about her conver-
sational rhythm, how receptive she is to your questions, and what cues she
gives when thinking about an answer. These tiny moments—from part of a
second to several seconds—are nerve-wracking. One way a novice inter-
viewer tries to counteract nervousness is by preemptively filling the silence.
So the interviewer asks long questions. What he wants to know is, “What did
you have for breakfast yesterday?” but the novice stretches the question out
so as to delay that moment where the question is done, and he is forced to
await the answer (or some awful unnamed fate). The question then becomes
“What did you have for breakfast yesterday…was it toast or juice?” The nov-
ice interviewer is suggesting possible responses, and his interviewee is just


How to Ask Questions
85
that much more likely to work within the interviewer’s suggestions rather
than offer up her own answers. In fact, what the novice interviewer probably
asked was, “What did you have for breakfast yesterday? Was it toast, or juice,
or…?” You can hear the novice interviewer actually articulate the ellipsis, as
a descending, slowly fading “Rrrrrrrr?” That trailing sound is the last gasp at
holding onto the question
Don’t do this. Ask your question and let it stand. Be deliberate about this. To
deal with your (potentially agonizing!) discomfort during the silence, give
yourself something to do—slowly repeat “allow silence” as many times as
it takes. Use this as a mantra to calm and clear your mind (at least for the
moment). If the person can’t answer the question, she will let you know.
After she has given you an answer, continue to be silent. People speak in
paragraphs, and they want your permission to go on to the next paragraph.
You ask “What did you have for breakfast yesterday?” There’s a second of
silence, and the person tells you, “I had toast and a bit of yogurt, and then
about 20 minutes later, I had steak and eggs.” Our novice interviewer figures
it’s time to move on to the next question, asking “Oh, okay. Where did you
buy those groceries?” But the best play is to just rest for another beat. Usu-
ally, the person will continue. “Well, in fact, yesterday was quite unusual
because what I typically do is just have a granola bar, but my sister was com-
ing to visit, and I had to prepare for all of us before she got here.” By simply
not asking your next question, you can give your interviewee time to flesh
out the answer they’ve already given you. Try to sense when the thread is
played out, and it’s time for your next question.
Tip Paragraph Speak
People do speak in paragraphs. You can see evidence of this by
looking at an interview transcription. The pauses between blocks
of content are interpreted by the transcriptionist as paragraphs.
Werner Herzog’s documentary Grizzly Man tells the story of Timothy
Treadwell, a self-professed naturalist who lived in the wilderness to be close
to his beloved grizzly bears, only to be mauled to death. There’s a scene in
which Franc Fallico, Alaska’s state medical examiner, presents a watch, still
in an evidence bag, to Treadwell’s ex-girlfriend, Jewel Palovak. Herzog, hold-
ing the camera, cuts between passively observing the dialogue between the
two of them and inserting his own questions about her memory of Treadwell
(and his girlfriend who died with him). Finally, Fallico has Jewel sign some
official papers, and the process is complete. Herzog doesn’t cut and con-
tinues to film the two. But nothing is happening! They have uttered their
concluding words and smile awkwardly and stare at nothing. Moments tick
by and still no cutting. Jewel gives a sharp intake of breath, and Herzog,
holding the camera, steps forward. Another moment goes by, and she sobs,
breaking down for the first time in this entire sequence. “It’s the last thing

86
Chapter 6
that’s left.” Herzog is directing the scene while observing and interviewing.
He lets a delicate moment hang uncomfortably, and a devastating emotion
emerges. That’s the power of silence.
Even if you don’t feel nervous, you can’t really know what’s going to hap-
pen as you ask a question.1 Perhaps your participant will start to answer
the question while you are asking it (indeed, you can see this sometimes
when the participant’s whole affect changes as he begins to understand
the question and his face shifts dramatically as he brings his answer out to
the launch pad). Perhaps he’ll be supremely fast-talking2 and whip out an
answer the very moment you’ve finished asking it. Perhaps he will wait for
you to finish your question and take some amount of time to start speaking,
and during that gulf between question and answer he may give you really
great “I’m thinking” cues (hand rubs chin, eyes gaze away, lips pursed, and
so on). Perhaps he’ll give you a juicy verbal cue, like “That’s a great ques-
tion…ummmm….” Or he may simply stare at you, giving no quarter, until he
answers. Be prepared for any of these!
With some participants, it takes me most of the interview to align my pac-
ing with theirs. I’m particularly vulnerable to what one might call the
Skype effect. When technology (VOIP, Skype, transatlantic cables, satellite
transmission, and so on) introduces a small delay in conversation, we get
messed up pretty quickly; the pauses we listen for at the end of someone’s
speech are not quite in real time and so we start to speak at the same time
as the person on the other end of the call. We hear each other start and so we
abruptly stop and defer to them. It’s challenging to correct this out-of-phase
state. Of course, this happens in person as well, without any technologically
introduced delay. Some people just have different natural rhythms. There’s
no magic fix, any more than there’s an easy way to successfully talk on the
phone when you hear an echo of your own voice. This is stuff happening way
below conscious thought, down at the autonomic level. At the very least, be
mindful of the out-of-sync phenomenon and try to slow…yourself…down.
Managing the Flow
At a high level, most of the interview can unfold naturally from the kickoff
question (see Chapter 5, “Key Stages of the Interview”). Strive to weave the
questions from your field guide into follow-up questions. Although it won’t
cover the entirety of the interview, pursuing this ideal will help develop
1	 Detailed analysis of “turn taking” is part of conversation analysis, a subdiscipline of linguis-
tics. Experts explore how intonation, pausing, and body language inform the interaction
between speakers. Unlike your work as an interviewer, conversation analysts don’t do their
work in real time.
2	 A wonderful example is the rapid-fire dialogue between Hildy and Burns in the 1940
Howard Hawks film His Girl Friday.

rapport, demonstrate listening, and create an interaction that feels more
conversational than interrogatory.
Not everything can be a follow-up. Some threads run out of steam, or some-
times you need to deliberately change the discussion in order to dig into
a specific area of interest. The guiding principle here is to signal your lane
changes. Compare these two snippets of a hypothetical interview:
Version 1
Q:	And what happened when you downloaded the updated version of

the iPhone app?
A: (laughs) It installed instantly!
Q: Where do you keep your used oil drums?
Version 2
Q: 	And what happened when you downloaded the updated version of

the iPhone app?
A: (laughs) It installed instantly!
Q: 	Okay, this is great. I’m just going to shift direction here. Maybe you

can tell us, where do you keep your used oil drums?
In the second snippet, the deliberate, explicit turn signal acknowledges the
most recent answer and points the way toward the next, otherwise discon-
tinuous, topic for discussion. As a rule, if your question isn’t fairly obviously
a follow-up question, you should preface it with some transitional words.
Getting to Even More of the Answer
Here’s some bad news: you won’t get the answer to your questions just by
asking. If only you could simply utter the question and wait while the person
gives you all the information you need, and then move on to the next ques-
tion on your list. That’s just not how real interviews go. For most threads in
most interviews, you need to use a series of questions to get to the informa-
tion you want. It’s not that people are being difficult; they just don’t know
what it is that you want to know. They interpret your question in a certain
way and do their best to answer it. But it’s up to you to help them to tell you
what you need to learn about.
When you listen to your participant answering your question, be vigilant. Do
they appear to have understood what you intended by the question, or have
they gone somewhere else with it? Their interpretation may be more reveal-
ing than what you intended, so you may just let the conversation go down
that path, or you might want to wait for an appropriate time to redirect back
to the topic you were initially interested in.

Silence Abroad
by Lynn Shade
Lynn Shade is a freelance UX designer and researcher who
previously worked at Claris, Apple, and Adobe. She grew up
in Japan and is bilingual.
Over the course of my career, most of the user research
I’ve done has been in Asia, in large part in Japan, where I
happened to grow up and where software companies used
to invest in efforts to understand market needs. Years ago
when working for Apple, I accompanied a Dutch colleague,
Anke de Jong, to New York for field research for new laptop
models. Trained as an industrial designer, Anke designed
at the intersection of hardware and software. This made
her research interesting in and of itself, but what I remember most vividly from that trip was
being occasionally astonished at her use of silence to impel further comment.
This technique wasn’t for the most part necessary since as compared to Asian participants,
these participants talked a lot. Admittedly, we were interviewing New Yorkers, but the will-
ingness and eagerness of American study participants to express themselves verbally was the
source of considerable discussion and hidden envy among myself and my Japanese colleagues.
In Silicon Valley at the time, the solo-participant-in-a-lab Talk Aloud methodology was
enjoying great popularity as the de-facto usability testing methodology. Upper management
expected this quick lab technique would be used to inexpensively confirm U.S. results in other
countries. Doing research in Japan wasn’t so easy. Beleaguered by the all-too-common silent-
ish Japanese participant, Japanese colleagues and I would discuss endlessly and even devote
entire conference presentations to how to draw our quiet participants out, and what magic
combination of factors might encourage them to speak.
However, even Americans can go silent after answering a question. If this happened, Anke
would deliberately not comment, waiting calmly and putting what seemed to me subtle stress
on the interviewee. The first few times I observed this, the Japanese part of me would grow
slightly anxious as the silence hung in the air for a half-beat too long. Invariably, the inter-
viewee would break it. The additional information was often valuable; they’d clarify or amend,
or start a new topic with a new observation, or make a connection that offered interesting
insights. The interviewees, while feeling the need to break the silence, seemed not to mind.
They often became very talkative, responding to the silence as the encouragement it was.
Using silence as a mechanism to elicit participants to talk is a common technique, but it stuck
in my head. Over the years as I continued doing research in Asia, I thought quite a bit about
that New York experience and silence in general. Silence in user research in Japan is so impor-
tant. We allowed lots and lots of room for it. There have been entire books written on Japanese
silence, but for the purposes of this sidebar I’ll summarize Japanese conversational silence into
three broad categories: setting-the-stage silence, effort silence, and failure silence.
Figure 6.1

How to Ask Questions

• Setting-the-stage silence: Along with body language, setting-the-stage silence is a spot
of silence from both sides to indicate readiness for a shared experience. Both parties
work to set the mood for a productive conversation, and some of this work is done with
silence. This silence takes place here and there during initial greetings, along the way as
topics change, and is most obvious when greetings wind down right before initiating the
topic at hand. Lest this paint the wrong picture of some prolonged zazen meditation-like
situation with a temple bell tolling in the background, let me hasten to add that those
setting-the-stage silences can be long or quick, depending on personalities. Fairly typical
in lots of situations is saying the equivalent of “um” with a trailing silence and the other
party nodding, again followed by a bit of silence. Setting-the-stage silence is created
partly because silence is considered a more deeply shared experience than talking—a
version of that exists in many cultures—and partly showing mutual respect and mutual
humility for the other’s expertise. The interviewer’s task here and during the interview
is to match the interviewee’s natural response and thought pace, allowing time for both
sides to ponder questions.
• Effort silence: During the interview, silence indicates making an effort to help the cause
along. The interviewee will be silent to show they’re thinking the topic over carefully and
showing a desire to contribute to the interviewer’s goal. The interviewer will be silent to
show they’re thinking the subject’s response over carefully and showing respect for the
effort the interviewee made in answering. All parties may be silent when faced with a
very difficult or complex question to show respect for the difficulty by giving it due dili-
gence and giving the question and the other parties room to think. Essentially, Japanese
people are being conversationally encouraging by using lots of silence.
• Failure silence: The tones of silence to watch for are silence indicating resistance and
silence indicating confusion. If the interviewees don’t feel knowledgeable enough or qual-
ified to answer the question, they’ll fall silent. Likewise, when confused by a question and
unsure, interviewees can fall silent. This “falling silent” has its own tiny cues and must
be broken by interjections from the interviewer. If the failure silence is overly prolonged,
the interviewee will start experiencing the stress of failure. This is why the waiting-with-
out-help technique used so successfully in New York wouldn’t work in Japan, at least not
without considerable modification.
The designer Kenya Hara has a rather lovely section in his book White on the meaning of empti-
ness in the Shinto shrine architecture. He describes how the space created by tying the tops of
four pillars with ropes creates emptiness that has potential as a vessel to receive thoughts and
feelings. He later goes on to tie silence to emptiness and suggests that silence has the possibil-
ity to enrich mutual comprehension. Building on this, it’s hard to imagine silence in Japanese
conversation as being created simply to facilitate a means to a certain end. Rather, success-
ful Japanese silence is a roomy empty space that, created by both parties, helpfully exists to
allow communication.

Chapter 6
Is there more that you need to probe further on? People sometimes speak in
coded terms: “…this was before the earlier situation that changed my pur-
chasing….” The “earlier situation” may be something they are uncomfortable
revealing, at least for now, or it may be that they aren’t sure if they have your
permission to share the specifics of the “earlier situation.” Even if you don’t
follow up immediately, it may be a topic you want to return to.
Are you asking the question in a way they can answer? In a study about
customer service, a participant complained passionately about the poor tele-
phone service he received from a retailer. I asked him how the service might
be different, but he could only speak about the current situation. Eventually
I shifted my tactics entirely, and we role-played an imagined future version
of the telephone interactions. My follow-up questions focused on uncovering
the specific details that made his scenario a desirable one.
A Palette of Question Types
The field guide is your (highly idealized) hypothesis for how you will ask
questions. But really, you’ll spend much of your effort in the interview dig-
ging further and giving your participant the best opportunity to share
deeply. You need a broad set of question types in order to make this happen.
Here are some examples to get you started:
Questions that gather context and collect details:
• Ask about sequence. “Describe a typical workday. What do you do
when you first sit down at your station? What do you do next?”
• Ask about quantity. “How many files would you delete when
that happens?”
• Ask for specific examples. “What was the last movie you streamed?”
Compare that question to “What movies do you stream?” The specific
is easier to answer than the general and becomes a platform for follow-
up questions.
• Ask about exceptions. “Can you tell me about a time when a customer
had a problem with an order?”
• Ask for the complete list. “What are all the different apps you have
installed on your smartphone?” This will require a series of follow-up
questions—for example, “What else?” Very few people can generate an
entire list of something without some prompting.
• Ask about relationships. “How do you work with new vendors?” This
general question is especially appropriate when you don’t even know
enough to ask a specific question (such as in comparison to the earlier
example about streaming movies). Better to start general than to be
presumptive with a too-specific question.


How to Ask Questions
91
• Ask about organizational structure. “Who do the people in that
department report to?”
Questions that probe what’s been unsaid:
• Ask for clarification. “When you refer to ‘that,’ you are talking about
the newest server, right?”
• Ask about code words/native language. “Why do you call it the
bat cave?”
• Ask about emotional cues. “Why do you laugh when you mention
Best Buy?”
• Ask why. “I’ve tried to get my boss to adopt this format, but she just
won’t do it….” “Why do you think she hasn’t?”
• Probe delicately. “You mentioned a difficult situation that changed
your usage. Can you tell me what that situation was?”
• Probe without presuming. “Some people have very negative feelings
about the current government, while others don’t. What is your take?”
Rather than the direct “What do you think about our government?”
or “Do you like what the government is doing lately?” This indirect
approach offers options associated with the generic “some people”
rather than the interviewer or the interviewee.
• Explain to an outsider. “Let’s say that I’ve just arrived here from
another decade, how would you explain to me the difference between
smartphones and tablets?”
• Teach another. “If you had to ask your daughter to operate your
system, how would you explain it to her?”
Questions that create contrasts in order to uncover frameworks and
mental models:
• Compare processes. “What’s the difference between sending your
response by fax, mail, or email?”
• Compare to others. “Do the other coaches also do it that way?”
• Compare across time. “How have your family photo activities changed
in the past five years? How do you think they will be different five years
from now?” The second question is not intended to capture an accurate
prediction. Rather, the question serves to break free from what exists
now and envision possibilities that may emerge down the road. Identify
an appropriately large time horizon (A year? Five years? Ten years?) that
helps people to think beyond incremental change.

92
Chapter 6
She Blinded Me with Silence
A while back I was in my first public improv show. We were all amateurs, some
with many years of experience, others with a year or less (such as me). In this
performance, we started each scene with one idea (often from the audience) and
proceeded with some sort of structure. What often happened was a scramble to
move the idea forward—everyone speaking at once, with too many ideas “thrown”
in the first few moments to ever really solidify into a great scene. Have you ever
seen 8-year-olds play soccer? The ball and both teams are a whirling cloud that
moves up and down and across the field like the Tasmanian Devil. That was us.
But then the next night I saw the Kids in the Hall—a comedy troupe that has been
performing together for a very long time. After the scripted material had finished,
the audience was clamoring for more. In advance of the encore, they all walked on
stage and thanked us, and then improvised a few jokes before heading off stage
to prepare for the encore. All five of them managed to hold the stage coherently.
Not everyone spoke at equal length in those few minutes, but at no point did any
of them speak on top of another. It came off as natural and easy, but it was really
quite incredible.
Where they succeeded, and we didn’t succeed as well (for there are no losers in
improv) was in allowing for silence. Each Kid in the Hall was silent for most, if not
all, of their unscripted segment. What a powerful contribution they made by not
speaking. Isn’t that a strange statement to make? A comedy performer contrib-
uted by not speaking. How can that be? We tend to expect performance to be the
explicit utterances, not the space between them.
There’s a lot that can happen without verbalization—posture, gestures, breath
sounds, eye gaze, facial reactions, and more. The Kids in the Hall were doing all
those the entire time—and they were paying attention to each other. When they
were silent, they were actively silent; they were sending and receiving information.


How to Ask Questions
93
This behavior is crucial when interviewing users. I would estimate we speak as lit-
tle as 20 percent of the time. Yet the interviews are directed and controlled by the
interviewer. Nodding, eye contact, and body language all support the respondent
in providing detailed information.
Of course, there is often more than one researcher on hand. If the first ethno-
grapher remains silent, waiting for the respondent to continue, the second
interviewer must recognize that, and also listen silently, rather than using the
opening as his chance to interview. This collaborative use of silence is something
the Kids in the Hall managed, and my improv group did not.
We experience these same challenges in more familiar work settings: brainstorm-
ing, meetings, and so on. We work in a society that judges us primarily by our
own contributions, rather than the way we allow others to make theirs. If the col-
laborative silence is not a shared value in a group, there can be a real challenge
for those who default to listening, not speaking. We’ve learned how to give credit
to those who utter the pearls, but we don’t know how to acknowledge the value of
those who choose their moments wisely, who allow others to shine, and who ulti-
mately enable those pearls.
In a 2002 episode of The Simpsons (DABF05, “Jaws Wired Shut”), Homer’s jaw is
wired shut. He is physically unable to speak. He does become a better listener, but
most interesting are the positive qualities the people in his life project upon him.
Simpsons’ Executive Producer Al Jean said: “When Homer gets his jaw wired shut,
it makes him into a really decent, wonderful human being.” I don’t know if Al Jean
is getting post-modern on us, but Homer’s internal change, through his silence,
was fairly minor compared to the differences that other people perceived. For even
more on this theme, check out the book Being There by Jerzy Kozinsky (or the film
with Peter Sellers).

Chapter 6
Managing the Ebb and
Flow of the Interview
As a plan for an idealized interview, the field guide is, of course, linear. But
the active planning process you go through during the interview is actually
more of a tree (see Figure 6.2).
This is a fairly typical snippet of an interview. It’s what is going on for the
interviewer that deserves some special focus here, though. As the participant
is explaining in his natural manner, the interviewer is identifying other ques-
tions to ask. At the first pause, the interviewer has at least two new questions
(beyond what’s already in her interview guide), but the questions encourage
the participant to continue by responding with “Okay.” As the participant
continues, she might identify another two topics to be explored. Maybe those
topics are included in the interview guide, but probably they aren’t.
Sadly, most of us are constrained by the linearity of time. We can’t clone our-
selves and follow each thread in parallel universes. We have to stick with our
own reality.
Figure 6.2
Even in this tiny
excerpt of an inter-
view, the interviewer
has to track a great
deal of information
and make choices
about where to
go next.


How to Ask Questions
95
In addition to watching the clock, maintaining eye contact, building rap-
port, and so on for most of the interview, your job also includes managing
this tree. Here are some coping techniques:
1.
Wait patiently until these threads come up again in conversation organ-
ically, without you having to ask. Often they do.
2.
Jot quick notes on your field guide about what you want to come back
to, so you don’t forget.
3.
Prioritize (or perhaps triage) based on your research objectives.
Although something that seems irrelevant does often prove to be
insightful, you have to choose. So be opportunistic and choose what you
think is going to bear fruit for your area of inquiry.
4.
Triage based on what makes the best follow-up, in order to demonstrate
listening and further the rapport.
Come back to a topic later if it still seems important; refer back to the
participant’s previous statement in order to establish continuity. (“Ear-
lier you mentioned using PayPal. I wanted to ask a bit more about that.”)
tip Going with the Flow
The complexity embedded within the exploding questions tree
might suggest that interviewing really sucks. In fact, dealing
with these challenges can take you to someplace very creative.
Mihály Csíkszentmihályi has articulated the psychological notion
of flow— as “the mental state of operation in which a person in
an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full
involvement, and success in the process of the activity.”3 This
certainly happens to me in interviews. My brain is firing on all
cylinders with all the responsibilities I’m managing, and yet I can
feel myself slow right down. It’s a feeling in both my brain and
my body, which compares to the familiar special effect, often
seen through the view screen when a spaceship enters hyper-
space and the stars stretch out from points into lines. In this
calmness, I’m not ignoring the complexity; instead, I’m somehow
above it. Things become very quiet in my head, and I can feel
myself riding on top of the challenges of the interview. It’s not
boredom; it’s a very engaged feeling. It’s the opposite of the
chicken-sans-head feeling you might imagine the demands of an
interview could lead to. This flow state both creates and is fed
by the imperative to keep silent, keep myself out of the equa-
tion, and let the experience breathe, while still being the most
creative and insightful time during fieldwork.

Chapter 6
Embracing Your Participant’s Worldview
In Chapter 2, I introduced the principle of embracing how participants see
their world. That principle informs the entire approach of a study, but it
becomes vital once you are with that participant and asking questions. In
this section, you’ll see how to ensure that your questions make it clear to
both you and your participant that you are curious, even hungry, to under-
stand their worldview.
Use Their Language
Years ago I was working with a client on understanding the opportunities for
a new home entertainment technology, targeting everyday consumers. We
were in the family’s home to speak with them about their current gear and
how they were using it.
In this house, the father had put a lot of effort into making product choices
that would enhance their family’s time together. He was visibly (and appro-
priately) proud of their setup. As he explained the choices he had made, he
explained how he didn’t want a DVR, because of his concerns over privacy. He
referred to the leading DVR brand, TiVo, but mispronounced it as “Tye-vo.”
“I took a look at Tye-vo, but didn’t want anyone paying attention to what
we watch the way Tye-vo does so I decided that Tye-vo wasn’t for us.” As
with many stories, this one has become richer in the retelling, but you can
imagine how my client, originally an engineer, quietly winced each time the
brand name was misspoken. I could sense his winces without turning my
head to look at him.
The interview continued and when it was appropriate for me to ask follow-up
questions about DVRs, I referred to it as the participant did—as Tye-vo. But
later, when the client asked some of his own questions, he pronounced TiVo
correctly as “tee-vo.” This was a small, yet dramatic moment in the interview.
This proud man was revealed to be, well, stupid, in front of his family, in his
home. Despite being a self-proclaimed expert in these types of products, he
was indirectly corrected and thus lowered in status. You could immediately
feel the power dynamic in the room shift; now we were the experts, and he
was just some dude. Of course, that’s not the situation I was hoping for!
My client was a wonderful, sweet, caring person who would never dream of
making this participant feel that badly. But it would have never occurred to
him to say something the “wrong” way. Yet in this situation, it was right to be
wrong. It wasn’t our role to be right.
Design researcher Todd Hausman talks about his work on an instant mes-
saging product, when research participants would refer to “emochicons.” In
reflecting back their pronunciation, he was viscerally reminded of the risk
in making assumptions about users.

Letting go of being right is something to pay attention to in most interviews;
it doesn’t have to be as glaring a situation as a participant’s mispronuncia-
tion of a technology or a brand name. It could be in the description of a part,
a process, or just about anything. Even if there’s not an obvious “right” or
“wrong” way to refer to something, you must defer to the participant’s way.
Tip When It’s Awkward to Use Their Language
It can be challenging to use someone else’s terminology and
feel as if you are being authentic. (After all, you are trying to
establish rapport, and being fake would destroy that.) Partici-
pants in a study told us about a new technology that was being
developed at their organization, called an aggregator. Due to
its troubled history, it was referred to colloquially as an “ag-
gravator.” This term was used more frequently in the interview
than “aggregator.” But it wasn’t comfortable for our interviewer
to ask about the “aggravator.” They didn’t really have permis-
sion from the group to use their insider language, and they ran
the risk of coming off as flippant or minimizing the seriousness
of the development effort. They resolved it by acknowledging
the participant’s language and their own reluctance to use the
same phrase. Going a little meta (such as “I want to ask about
what you like to call the aggravator”) enables the interviewer
to point to the language directly, acknowledging the partici-
pant’s terminology, as well as referring back to the previous
conversation about the terminology itself. When the words be-
ing used become a topic in the interview, pointing to the words
in this manner is appropriate.
In one project, a research participant referred to a technology platform their
firm uses. Our client, perhaps trying to demonstrate insider status and reas-
sure the participant that this interview was valid, asked about the platform
but used an abbreviated form (in essence, a nickname) of the platform name.
The participant responded by hesitantly using this nickname and then
immediately correcting himself and switching back to the full name that
he had originally used. If my client simply had to introduce his alternative
name for the technology, he could have asked “Oh, when you say [platform
name], I wonder if that’s the same thing I’m used to calling [nickname]?” In
this case, there would be no ambiguity, and he would not in any way be try-
ing to clarify, so the better course of action would have been to build rapport
by accepting the terms the participant was using rather than trying to dem-
onstrate credibility.

Assume Your Participant Makes Sense
You may hear and see apparent contradictions. People may tell you they value
cleanliness and then open a bedroom door to reveal piles of dirty clothes on
the floor. Or people may express a preference for a certain type of feature and
then reject an example you show them. Although you might find this frustrat-
ing, try to see it as an opportunity. Your interpretation of “cleanliness” may be
oversimplified. The social performance of valuing cleanliness may be entirely
separate than the act of maintaining cleanliness. Your framework for what
that feature is doing may not align with the participant’s framework. These
seeming disconnects are indications that you need to explore further. This
isn’t about calling out hypocrisy; it’s about probing to understand.
Don’t Make Your Questions Pass/Fail
A client joined me in the field, arriving at our pre-meeting with mere
moments to get acquainted and review the approach. This was not an ideal
arrangement (and a good learning moment for me) and led to a dysfunc-
tional dynamic. Her abrupt questions for our participant were presented
more as tests than as inquiries. She asked our participant if she knew what
a USB cable was (see Figure 6.3), phrasing it as a challenge rather than as
something she was curious about. Later, she presented her framework for
the digital media functionality she was charged with designing and asked
the participants if they understood the difference between the various terms
used in the framework. As an exercise, imagine asking someone if they know
what a USB is. You might even try this out loud. First, ask in a gentle, curious
fashion. Next, ask in a judgmental critical tone. In this case, my client was
somewhere in between, but far too close to the critical side of the continuum
for comfort. The participant became confused and very uncertain about how
to talk about her usage since these terms were indeed unfamiliar. It’s good to
understand if the language you are using internally aligns with the way peo-
ple are really talking, but that doesn’t mean you need to thrust your terms at
people and test them on whether or not they can explain them.

Don’t Presume They Accept Your Worldview
I interviewed a young man who had gone through a significant personal
change, first living abroad as a successful professional, and then returning
to California to live in his parents’ home to go back to school. At one point in
the interview, my client commented to our participant (let’s call him Keith)
about the differences in value systems between “Old Keith” and “New Keith.”
Even though this is not a framework that Keith had explicitly articulated to
us, he said, “Right.”
After a few minutes of further dialogue, I decided it was time to intercede,
and I asked Keith what he thought about this idea of the old versus new
Keith. Given the chance to expound, Keith told us, “I don’t really see it.”
At no point had Keith told us that he had old and new versions of himself.
Keith was always Keith. My client was synthesizing on-the-fly and had
imposed his model on Keith. And what did Keith do? He agreed. Of course
he agreed! Why should he argue about something like that? Just because a
framework isn’t rejected by the participant doesn’t mean it is accurate!

Good and Bad Examples from Marc Maron
In an episode of Marc Maron’s WTF podcast,4 he spoke with 85-year-old comedy
legend Jonathan Winters. Within this interview are several examples that embody
the points I’ve made throughout this chapter—getting to more of the answer, ask-
ing clarification questions, managing the ebb and flow of the interview, and not
presuming that the participant accepts the interviewer’s worldview.
Early in the interview, Maron asked a fairly direct question:
You were in the Marines. Where were you?
Winters answered:
I went in at 17. The Japanese were way down on the list…Pearl Harbor. I didn’t get
along with either parent; they were divorced; it didn’t seem to matter; they didn’t
like me.
His truth-in-comedy comment about his parents seemed to be a non-sequitur, and
he continued on about his parents and some of his time in the Marines for more
than three minutes (finally explaining that he was on an aircraft carrier, which
answered Maron’s question), before concluding with:
But I enjoyed the Marines…I only made corporal, but that’s okay…
Maron picked up on the earlier non-sequitur and asked:
Was it a way to get out of your parents house?
And Winters quipped back:
Yeah, yeah, they were eager to sign. I never saw two people sign papers so fast!

How to Ask Questions
101
Although the answer to Maron’s question was buried within several layers of
stories, Winters only implied his motivation for enlisting. Maron did the right
thing and asked his subject explicitly about it. As the interviewer, you want to
find out for sure, from the subject’s perspective, rather than leaving things to your
own inferences.
Later in the interview, Maron was less successful as an interviewer. Winters
described an early job working as a radio DJ. In this job, he eventually got bored
and did interviews with himself, playing different characters. Management
objected, Winters persisted, and he was fired:
Winters: I did try some more guests and that was the end of that career there.
Maron (laughing, interjected): You had to, though, right?
Winters: I had to.
Maron: Yeah! It felt too good, right?
Winters: It felt good. I did a year there, and then I went to Columbus.
Maron’s interjections reflected his own interpretation: that Winters must have
been compelled to continue doing interviews with himself because of how good
it felt. Winters never actually said that, but Maron stated it as a fact, where his
“right?” was not truly a question but more like a fellow bar patron elbowing you
in the ribs while asking you to agree with him. What this transcription failed to
capture was the momentum Winters had in telling his story, and even though he
agreed with Maron, he was sidetracked from his story and ended up expressing
parts of it in Maron’s terms, not his own.

Chapter 6
Don’t Enter Lecture Mode
An alternative title here might be “Sit on your hands!” or “You don’t need to
give voice to every thought that comes into your head!” On a project that
dealt with online decision support tools, one client, when offered the chance
partway through the interview to follow up on the conversation so far, came
up with this gem, presented here in sanitized form.
I suppose that seems more like a divergent set of factors informing
you versus specific feedback that came from any particular indi-
vidual source and that served as a guiding factor for decisions for
your purchase or not. I’m just thinking that it’s more of a multiple...
At this point, the participant interrupted the client to tell us more about her
decision-making process. Although sharing your forming thoughts can be
a method of interrogation, it is a tricky approach, relying heavily on rapport
and shared agenda to be effective. That was not what was happening here. The
client didn’t really say anything about anything but was just thinking aloud.
Although I’m a huge enthusiast for sense making, it would have been fine for
the client to have kept this in his head and declined to ask any questions.
But, within a minute of the exchange, the emboldened client continued,
making declarative summary statements about the utility of a specific type
of online tool. His descent into lecture mode was complete; he was not ask-
ing questions, but instead was sharing his own beliefs. He had transformed
from a listener to a teller.
Note
Learning from Mistakes
I’m really beating up on “clients” a lot here! But there is no
anti-client subtext at all; when you team up expert interviewers
(my team) and novices (our clients) you get a glorious supply
of illustrative examples. These examples remind me not to do
these things; I’m using them to tell you not to do these things,
and for both of us to coach our respective clients not to do
these things either!
If You Have to Fix Something, Wait Until the End
If you are interviewing someone about your product, it will be tempting to
help her have the best experience possible. You will invariably watch her
struggle to find features, express a desire for something that you know is
available, or hear her describe aspects of the product incorrectly. This can be
very trying for an interviewer who is also passionate about the product. (Of
course you are! After all, you are out in the field meeting customers in order
to make the product better!) So how do you deal with this?
Do not jump in and correct or instruct her. This is just like the TiVo example,
only more so! You are conducting the interview to learn from this person, so


How to Ask Questions
103
there’s no need to assert your own expertise. In fact, once you do so, you can
lose control over the interview entirely, as the participant will simply turn it
around and ask you, “Is there a way to do_____? How can I make _______
happen?” Suddenly, your field visit has turned into the world’s most expen-
sive tech support house call.
By all means, at the end of the interview, as you are handing over the incen-
tive and packing up, take a moment to share anything that you think might
help that person. But ask yourself if explaining something is better for you or
better for her. Don’t correct her perceptions or terminology if the only out-
come is “educating” her. Advocate for her, not for your product.
I led an interview with a fascinating professional who blew our minds with
his insights into building up a professional network over decades of his
career. As he was showing us how he worked, we saw him complain as he
struggled to move the cursor between his two monitors, as the one on the
left was set in Windows to be on the right. After we were finished, I offered to
fix this, since it was something that came up peripherally in discussion. He
was absolutely thrilled and quipped that this bit of support (even more than
the incentive, or the tips my clients had given him about how to use their
product) made the whole time worthwhile! Hyperbole or not, I was glad to be
able to do something nice for him after he had been so wonderful to us.
Summary
When you’re out in the field, actually doing your interview, keep the
following in mind:
• Your field guide is a guide. Set it aside until you really need it.
Leading the interview successfully comes down to you.
• Although it’s tricky, ask the shortest question you can, with-
out directing them to possible answers you are looking for. Then
be silent.
• When you move from one topic to another, use transitional phrases
such as “Great, I’d like to shift directions now….” or “Let’s go back
to something you said before….”
• Pay attention to whether or not you have received an answer to
your question. Be prepared to follow up multiple times using differ-
ent types of questions.
• Reflect back the language and terminology that your participant
used (even if you think it was “wrong”).
• If you want to fix something (say, a setting on their software) for
your participant, wait until the interview is over.

Chapter 7
O
n one level, documentation is how you capture the definitive, fully
detailed record of the interview (the “data”). On another level, it’s
how you, as the interviewer, make the ah-has and other important
take-aways stick. While doing this, you have to stay engaged with the par-
ticipant. Beyond that, documentation also bleeds into the sense making and
storytelling that follow fieldwork.
Taking Notes
Although you might be tempted to try, you simply can’t catch everything by
taking notes. Typical handwriting is about 30 words per minute, and a great
typist can do 60 wpm. Audio books are at least 100 wpm (and likely closer
to 150 wpm). But people speak less clearly—and more quickly—than in an
audio book. The cold math tells us it’s just not possible to get everything
down. Add the high cognitive load of leading an interview (as I talked about
in the previous chapter), and you’re done for. As transcriptionist Jo Ann Wall
puts it, “It can be a challenge to listen purposefully in order to determine
matters of importance and screen out extraneous information.”
You do need to get everything. In the moment, you will miss details, miscon-
strue intent, or mishear a word. It’s important to have an accurate version
of the interview to go back to. The bottom line is that you should be record-
ing your interviews—something I talk more about in more detail later in
this chapter.
While I prefer to focus entirely on my interaction with the participant, some
people find that taking notes helps them filter, synthesize, and ultimately
better remember what is being discussed. The act of writing notes helps
them process what is happening. They come away from the interview with
pages and pages of handwritten rough notes. If you do this, remember that
you must maintain eye contact while writing. Don’t rely too heavily on ask-
ing your participants to wait while you catch up with what they’ve said.
Worse still, you don’t want to evoke the clichéd therapist who is bent into her
notebook, muttering “mmm-hmm” and never looks up. By the same token,
avoid overly signaling what you are interested in by scribbling furiously in
response to certain types of input or response.
If, like me, you don’t benefit from the act of note taking, you can assign
this task to another researcher who joins you (or even a third party who is
simply tasked with documentation). As you include other forms of docu-
mentation, you can easily become overwhelmed with devices and tasks
outside leading the interview itself, so consider what can be assigned to a
supporting interviewer.


Documenting the Interview
107
As mentioned in the previous chapter, you can also take notes about what
you want to remember during the interview, as a way to manage the expand-
ing tree of the interview, as well as jot down topics you want to come back to.
Note
(Mis)interpretations in the Moment
In one interview, I asked a participant, “If you and your wife
own one iPod, how do you determine who is going to use it?”
He responded, “Well, for commuting, it’s either the iPod or the
New Yorker.” Two different scenarios are likely—1. She takes
the iPod on the train, and he drives the car, a New Yorker, or

## Whoever takes the iPod gets to listen to music, and the


spouse gets to read the most recent issue of the New Yorker
magazine. I didn’t get to ask a clarification question, and it
wasn’t until I went back to the video that it was clear that he
was referring to the magazine. In that same session, the partici-
pant, talking about iPods and design told us, “Well, when you
do that, it looks more Zen. It actually looks like the competi-
tion” and another participant added, “Yes, it’s like he says, very
Zen, very Japanese, very spiritual.” But that’s not what the first
participant meant by “Zen.” He was referring to another MP3
player that was around at the time, called the Creative Zen.
Misinterpretations in the moment are inevitable, so you need
proper documentation to resolve it later.
Typing vs. Writing Your Notes
Many people can type faster than they can write. Typed notes can easily be
shared electronically, and no one has to read your handwriting or interpret
your spelling errors. However, taking notes on a computer creates other
challenges. Do you have sufficient battery power or will you have to plug in?
Can you type without clackety-clacking? What if you move around in the
environment? Can you quickly move your laptop and still type on whatever
surface is at hand? Can you continue to appear engaged even as you glance
back and forth at the screen? Although this is also an issue when writ-
ing notes by hand, breaking eye contact to look at a screen can appear to
be more rude (as participants wonder if you are checking email), while the
screen itself can be more distracting for you.
Tablets and smartphones offer an alternative: although you won’t be seen
hiding behind the screen or lid, looking at a mobile device during the inter-
view can be even more fraught with faux pas. It’s not impossible to work
around this issue, but simply showing up and using your smartphone as if
you were in a meeting or on a date isn’t going to cut it. Throw in the lower
typing speeds, and you’re limited in what you can do with these.

108
Chapter 7
It’s a good bet that interviewers who use note taking to help remember the
interview are doing some kinesthetic learning; perhaps that effect isn’t quite
as strong when typing. If your goal is to juice your own memory, stick with
writing. If you want roughs of the interview that can be shared (and you can
keep your device interactions on the down-low), then type. And if you live
for the moment, set it all aside and just focus on your interactions with your
participant. Regardless, make sure that you are recording the entire inter-
view using audio or video, as I discuss later in this chapter.
Note
LiveScribe Smartpen
LiveScribe makes something called a smartpen, which is a pen
that records both audio and handwritten text (using special
paper). After an interview, you can play back the audio from
a certain portion of the interview by tapping on the relevant
spot in your notes. Researchers who like taking notes find it
generally unobtrusive and effective. Since I’m not an active
notetaker, it’s probably not a solution for me, but ethnographer
Tricia Wang documents her evolving experience with her
LiveScribe at http://rfld.me/ZunZGi.
The Notetaker’s Voice
When taking notes, you should be descriptive, not interpretive. If Larry tells
you he has worked 14 hours a day for the last 10 years, your notes should read
“Worked 14 hrs/day for 10 years,” not “Larry is a workaholic.” If it’s crucial to
capture your interpretations, be sure to separate them from your observa-
tions, using capitalization or some other visual cue, such as “IS LARRY A
WORKAHOLIC?” At this stage of rough notes, it’s easy to lose track of what
you were told versus the conclusions you made, so take care in how you doc-
ument the two.
Audio Recording the Interview
An audio recording will capture all the verbal interactions between you and
your participants. Of course, you can’t see the demonstrations or exercises.
Something like “I’d probably put this one with that one because they’re
kinda the same” might be hard to interpret later if you don’t remember
which items were being discussed. Although you can facilitate the discus-
sion for the benefit of the audio recording (narrating what the participant
is doing, like “So you would put the blue prototype in the same group as the
orange prototype?”), it can feel unnatural. You shouldn’t be treating the doc-
umentation as more important than the interpersonal interaction.


Documenting the Interview
109
Depending on the environment, you can probably get away with a simple
digital audio recorder. They are small and hold hours and hours of audio.
Some background noise—especially clattering dishes and background
music—can appear more prominent in the recording than you experience it,
so perform some tests. Be aware of how loud you and your participant will
sound in the final recording.
You might want to add an external mic to your audio recorder; think about
whether it will allow you to move around the environment and whether it
will pick up audio from multiple directions (at the very least, there’s you and
your respondent). Especially for the audio-tech newbie, I don’t recommend a
body microphone—everyone will have to be mic’d, and often a new partici-
pant will join spontaneously, different mics need to be mixed, and so on. The
biggest concern is that attaching a body microphone is an intimate act that
needs to happen at the beginning of the interview. When your relationship
with the participant is at its most vulnerable, they will need to—with your
guidance—attach a small device to their clothing, near their face. This is a
delicate interaction that doesn’t seem necessary if you can be satisfied with
the audio quality.
You can also use a recording app in your smartphone, but test it first. Does
your phone have enough capacity? What happens if a call comes in? Will
your batteries last? And are you able to easily monitor the recording status
of the app? There’s nothing worse than realizing that your recording device
has not actually been recording for the past half hour!
Tip Transcribing Your Audio Files
You can get transcripts of your audio files (or even of the audio
track of your video files). There are many transcription services
that will take digital files via FTP (as they may be too large
to email) and email back Word documents a few days later.
Most services can remove “ummm…” and other hesitations and
repeated words. This is called a “clean verbatim” transcript.
I prefer to have those bits and pieces included because they
help make the transcription come alive, revealing the personal-
ity of the respondent as well as illustrating the thinking process
that goes into answering questions. I think this sort of human
metadata is helpful in interpretation and analysis.
Costs for transcription depend on the total number of voices
(how many interviewers and how many participants) as well as
other typical factors like turnaround time, but you can expect
to pay between $1.50 to $2.00 per minute.

How to Get Video as Good as Your Insights
by Ted Frank
Ted Frank is a storyteller with Backstories Studio. He has
been in marketing for over 20 years and in consumer insights
and strategy for more than 10.
As a company that has created hundreds of videos for
research and strategy firms, Backstories Studio has seen
too many examples of stellar research work become unus-
able because of poor video or sound quality. And it breaks
our hearts. What’s more, for some clients, the video deliv-
erable is often the only way they see your insights. So it
often becomes the way they evaluate you as well.
Here are some tips to get high-quality video, even if you have only five minutes to set up and
have never been to film school:
• Respondent placement: Where you place your respondents is the biggest key to getting
good quality. Pick a space that is quiet and bright enough to see the color of your respon-
dent’s eyes. And unless it’s important to the project, select a place where the background
does not distract from your respondent.
• Light: People tend to look best when light comes from the side and slightly in front of
them (up to a 45º angle). A window works great in the daytime. Lights will work at night.
Don’t place your respondents with the window behind them, or they will appear dark.
Lights shining down will light them, but they will appear older because of the shadows
those lights create. Lighting them from the front will also work, but they can end up look-
ing like an episode of Cops, and if light is in their eyes, it will make it difficult for them to
see you. See Figure 7.2 for an optimal setup.
• Sound: In research, sound quality is often even more important than picture quality,
especially if you’re picking clips by what your respondents say. Where you place your
microphone is everything. It’s just like real life: People sound intimate when they’re close
to you and can be hard to hear when they’re across the street. Shotgun mics work well for
groups if you can point them at the person speaking. Because that’s difficult, though, a
second mic in the center of the group will save you. A lot of researchers get scared when
they see that some of these mics can cost $400. However, if you rely on your camera mic
alone, you’ll end up paying that same money in editing costs to reduce the room noise.
And your clip will still never sound as good as it would have if you placed the mic closer
to your respondent to begin with. So it’s better to spend the money initially and let
your work shine.

• Setting up the camera: Thankfully, cameras have gotten a lot better over the years. An
HD camera is a lot more affordable and will give your editor many more options for your
final video. When setting up your camera, place it in front of your respondent, with the
moderator in between it and the light or window (refer to Figure 7.2). It works best if the
respondent is framed a bit to one side and looking across the frame, toward the modera-
tor. When respondents look directly into the camera, the setting appears staged.
Frame your picture close if you want to capture emotion, but leave room in case your subject
shifts or sways (and he always does). That will also leave you room for a nametag if you choose
to place one in your video. Finally, look again at your respondent’s eyes. If you can’t see the
color, move the light closer until you can.
Practice a few times before you get into field, and you’ll be able to set all this up in just a few min-
utes. You’ll end up with impressive video, and a lot fewer hours and expenses down the line.

Chapter 7
Video Recording the Interview
Video cameras are small, unobtrusive, and make for a viable default record-
ing device. I take audio recorders as backup, but rely on video in most
situations. With a video camera, you can capture the specifics of what the
participant means by, “That part right there is the best one to use.” You
also can capture body language and nuanced elements in the conversation,
which, of course, is not possible with audio recordings.
Buy an inexpensive mini (or “tabletop”) tripod. This will make it easier to set
the camera down during stationary parts of the interview, but will still allow
you to easily grab it when you move around the environment. I haven’t found
that the presence of the camera is intimidating for people (especially in a
post-YouTube era where it’s a medium that we are all generally more familiar
with), but setting it and forgetting it helps to focus you on the participant
and the interview, rather than on the camera. When you are holding the
camera, be aware that, even when it’s facing away from you, the microphone
is much closer to your mouth than the participant’s, so be sensitive to your
interjections, snickers, and mm-hmms, as they will really pop on the audio.
For the novice interviewer, don’t worry about moderating your rapport
building for the camera, but for everyone else, it’s worth keeping in mind.
Tip Don’t Run Out of Juice!
Be sure to have enough batteries on hand to get through the
interview. I’ve found that cameras ship with a fairly small battery,
but larger-capacity batteries are available, including compatible
ones from third-party manufacturers. Shop online and stock up.
Although some cameras can adjust for backlighting, you should gener-
ally avoid having your participants in front of a window; even if you can see
them, they will probably just appear in silhouette on the video.
Be prepared to manage the large files you create. Even on the lowest-quality
settings, over the course of a small study you can end up with 20GB of video
without trying too hard. That much digital data can fill up drives and is
almost impossible for mortals (those of us with non-Pixar quality infrastruc-
ture) to move around a network.
Even if we don’t edit video into a specific deliverable, it’s often the richest
archival artifact of the fieldwork. Video also reassures our clients that they
can go back at any time to watch the interviews.
Photographing the Interview
Even if you’re capturing imagery using video, still pictures are essential. When
you make the deliberate choice to point and shoot, you are building the story of
your participant. Even if the image in the camera is similar to a frame of video,


Documenting the Interview
113
that frame is packed in with all the other frames of video and requires effort
for you to extract. You can return from the field with a set of photos and easily
share an impromptu narrative of the interview by flipping through the photos
on the camera. Even better, you will notice details in the photo that you didn’t
consciously perceive at the time. Video, with its audio track and its movement
through time, doesn’t as easily afford that extra detail. You might choose to just
take still pictures and record audio and not bother recording video.
Be aware of how your picture taking will feel to the participants. Even
though they agree to the use of photography when they sign your release,
let the interview settle in before you start taking pictures. You can verbally
confirm that it’s okay before you take your first picture. If you are taking pic-
tures of people, do it without the flash. If your second interviewer is taking
pictures, they should not distract from the interview.
As I mentioned in Chapter 3, prepare a shot list so you have some ideas about
which pictures you need to take.
Sketching the Interview
Sketching can be an appropriate medium when you can’t take pictures. If
you can’t get an image of the participant’s online banking screen, you can
sketch the different regions of the interface and write callouts for some of
his comments. Because he can see the sketch, he can be reassured that you
aren’t capturing private information and can clarify and correct your notes.
Caroline James takes that even further, using sketching as an active method
to reflect back to her participants what she’s hearing and to draw them out
further (see Figure 7.3). She uses a combination of several specific techniques:
visual recording, mind mapping, and visual note taking (sometimes referred
to as “sketch noting”).1 She sketches in front of (and even with) her interview
participants to engage them in creating a visual document of the interview.
I worked in the field with designer Jorge Gordon. His technique for note tak-
ing lay somewhere in between purely visual and purely textual; he used only
words and lines but created a visual flow that captured his own experience
(see Figure 7.4). As with many aspects of interviewing users, note taking can
be highly individualistic.
Tip Collecting Artifacts
Collect tangible examples from your fieldwork experience—buy
an item from the company store, ask for a brochure, save your se-
curity pass, or keep the sample printout. These artifacts can go up
on the wall in your analysis room, be passed around in meetings,
or referred to later for inspiration, validation, or further insight.

Debriefing After the Interview
When putting together your fieldwork schedule, you must absolutely allow
time for debriefing after each interview. After you leave the fieldwork site,
go for food and drink and talk about the interview. The longer you wait (say,
until the next day or the next week), the less you will remember, and the
more jumbled up the different interviews will become.
If you debrief as an open-ended conversation, make sure that someone takes
notes (and shares them with everyone). Otherwise, use a debrief worksheet
(see Figure 7.5) to capture initial thoughts, surprises, and changes for sub-
sequent interviews. Ask, “What would we design for this user?” Don’t worry
about being too conclusive; this is a provocative way to start making sense
of the interview. You aren’t making design decisions; this is hypothetical,
speculative, and easily discarded when future data takes you in a different
direction. Make sure that your fellow researchers understand hypothesizing
conclusions as a creative exercise.

Taking Field Notes
Many researchers sit down shortly after the interview and write up notes in
some detail, using their notes, memory, and recordings. These field notes can
easily run several pages long and emphasize narrative and description over
conclusions or business implications. This is a time-consuming task and
something I’ve stopped doing, especially since I began using transcripts. For
trained social scientists, this is likely part of their training and an essential
part of their process; while it is undoubtedly valuable, consider whether you
have time in your schedule to do this.
Sample Field Highlights
by Kristine Ng, for the Omni Project2
The Elway family is composed of Arthur (dad), mom, and three kids (ages 13, 10, and 7).
They recently moved to City 1 from City 2 and didn’t have Internet for a month, which the
kids thought was dreadful.
Arthur and two kids—Denise and Hayley—took part in the interview. Denise has a Kindle
Fire, iPod, iHome, and cell phone. She really wanted a Nook, but her father persuaded her
otherwise, since B&N isn’t a tech company. She said she’s tired of Apple products. She
FaceTimes with her friends instead of talking on the phone, and sometimes texts them.
Hayley has a first-gen iPad and iPod. She’s eagerly waiting until she’s old enough to get a
cell phone. She’s been promised one in February when she starts soccer, more as a means of
communication with parents for rides and so on.
Regulating device use is a main concern for the family. Denise lost access to the Kindle as
a punishment for misuse. Dad said that when they’re doing homework they’re only allowed
to listen to music, but the girls have been caught FaceTiming and watching TV while doing
homework. Arthur is interested in a solution for regulating these multi-use devices since part
of their use is educational. He mentioned that City 2 is more affluent and the peer pressure
is greater. There are second graders with cell phones (he doesn’t think they need them) and
13-year-old girls with 10 pairs of Uggs. They’re constantly trying to determine how to hold
onto their values while understanding that peer pressure is real. Both parents closed their
Facebook accounts, partially to be good role models, but her father also has privacy concerns.
He would love to know what the best practices and guidelines are for device regulation.

Sharing Field Highlights
As soon as possible after an interview, I write a rapid top-of-mind version of
the session. I am not focused on capturing all the details but am creating a
sharable story that brings a bit of the flavor of the fieldwork to the broader
team. With practice, these highlights (which I affectionately refer to as “quick-
ies”) take only a few minutes to write and email. Some of the effort to produce
these highlights is in restraining yourself from trying to produce field notes.
See an example of field highlights in Kristine Ng’s sidebar on p. 116.
Summary
By documenting the interview, you are capturing a definitive detailed
record of the interview. It’s also a way for you to process and remem-
ber the insights and take-aways that come to you while the interview
is happening.
• You can’t catch everything by taking notes. You do need to get
everything. In the moment, you will miss details or mishear a word.
• Recording audio or video is the only way to capture all the details
of your interview.
• If you take notes on a computer or other device, can you do so silently
and maintain your engaged eye contact with the participant?
• Notes should be descriptive rather than interpretive; when you
go back to them later, it’s hard to tell the difference between what
actually happened and your own interpretations.
• Use a small video camera with a pocket tripod or a simple digital
audio recorder; external mics will improve audio quality, but body
mics create an awkward interaction with the participant when
setting up.
• Have plenty of batteries for all of your devices and be aware of how
long they should last.
• Take lots of pictures; they often reveal something different later on.
• Sit down with the field team right after the interview and debrief
about key take-aways. Soon after, write up quick highlights and
share them with the rest of your team.

Chapter 8
A
n interview is an interaction between two humans. Or throw in a
colleague and a spouse, and now it’s an interaction between four
humans—irrational, emotional, language-using, unpredictable
humans. The only one of these four you have any control over is yourself.
This is a messy business. There will always be variables and curve balls. This
chapter looks at some of the more common challenges that you will face in
the field. It also suggests a number of ways to develop your own skills so that
you are prepared for future surprises.
Troubleshooting Common
Interview Problems
Many of the situations discussed in this section stem from something that
happened leading up to the interview, such as how the participants were
recruited. The best troubleshooting approach is to prevent these problems
from occurring through proper screening and clear setting of expectations.
Realistically, though, they will still come up.
When the Participant Is Reticent
Are you sure that your participant is holding back? As discussed in Chap-
ter 6, his default demeanor and speaking rhythm may simply be out of sync
with yours.
If you conclude that he is indeed uncomfortable, try to identify the cause and
make a change in the way you are handling the interview. You might simply
need to accept the awkwardness and be patient with yourself and with him,
looking toward a point where he becomes more comfortable. If he is con-
necting better with one of your colleagues, ask that person to lead the rest
of the interview. If there are too many interviewers, ask one of them to step
back. If you aren’t giving your participant enough verbal space to reflect and
respond, slow down and let him talk. If your participant needs more struc-
ture, fall back to straightforward, direct questions.
Consider which aspects of your topic might be making him uncomfortable.
Even if an interview doesn’t explore social taboos, you may be tapping into
an element of personal insecurity about his job, his competence, his intelli-
gence, and so on. Or you can change the topic, share your enthusiasm for his
talent, or reveal something about yourself.
Sometimes you might find yourself in a different situation than you had
anticipated. For example, an interview with a certain type of professional
turns out to be an interview with that person and his manager. If you can’t
get the interview you want (perhaps by gently suggesting you interview
them each separately), be aware of the dynamics and adjust your questions
appropriately. Ask the manager questions about herself or about her under-
standing of how the work is performed.


Optimizing the Interview
121
If all else fails, consider asking your participant outright to identify the
source of his discomfort. Tell the participant that this information is impor-
tant to you and your work and that you are deeply interested, but you are
concerned that he isn’t comfortable with the conversation. Ask what would
be better, even if it means a different time or a different location.
When the Participant Isn’t the Right Kind of User
Assuming you’ve screened your subject, you might wonder how that person
can end up being wrong for the study. If you are surprised—or even uncom-
fortable—at how reality differs from what you expected, that’s a crucial
insight. But don’t be hasty to dismiss the participant.
If you’ve taken the time to travel to this participant’s home or workplace, you
should complete the interview. Consider what you might do with the 45 min-
utes you could save by cutting out early and how that stacks up against
the possibility that you might learn something by interviewing this person
about his experience and perspective. Reset your expectations and see what
you can get out of the session. Afterward, revisit your screening criteria. You
may have uncovered the fact that a word or phrase in the criteria is being
interpreted differently by participants (for example, “late-model car” could
mean one thing to your team and another to the people you are recruiting).
Also, if you have identified additional factors for the rest of the participants,
you might want to rescreen them.
Note
Getting the Right Participant
and the Right Context
In several studies, I recruited participants who were users of
various devices (like laptops, video cameras, and MP3 players).
They had told us they owned these devices and used them
for whatever tasks we were interested in. But several times I
found myself at the interview, discovering that the device in
question wasn’t actually at their home, where the interview
was conducted. One person worked for an airline and had
homes in two cities. Another person met us at his girlfriend’s
house, where none of his stuff was located. Another lived with
roommates and her young children, while her computer was
at the home of their father. And so on. After this happened a
few times, I updated the language of my screener to ensure
that the interview would take place in their primary residence
and where the device was, and that they would be prepared to
show us the device during the interview.
During another project, we were seeking people who were
actively sharing certain types of information. One participant
was indeed actively sharing this information, but only with his

122
Chapter 8
immediate family, with whom he lived some of the time. We
hadn’t specified that “sharing” should take place with a broad-
er network, and even though we had reviewed the screener
with our client, no one had seen this as a concern. From this
interview, it emerged that we all had different ideas of what
“sharing” meant. Our client was very concerned since they had
conceived of sharing as a different behavior. In the interview
itself, we focused on learning everything we could from this
participant, but in the aftermath we had a number of intense
conversations with the client to determine whether or not this
participant was acceptable for the study.
When the Participant Won’t Stop Talking
As you settle into a rhythm with participants, you may realize that they talk
extensively, requiring little or no prompting from you. Before you try to “fix”
this issue, ask yourself whether this really is a problem. You have prepared
extensively and have a lot of questions you’re hoping to ask, but are you get-
ting what you need from this participant? If you don’t feel in control, you
might be annoyed, but keep the emotional factor separate and assess the
interview in terms of the information you need. In some cases, they won’t
be answering your questions at all. Give them space to tell the story they’ve
chosen to tell you and then redirect them back to your question. For exam-
ple, consider the following exchange, which is drawn from a real experience:
Q: What kind of food do you prepare for yourself?
A: When I was a child [long story about her mother, etc., etc.]
Q: So how does that experience as a child impact the decisions you
make now for your family?
Your last resort is to interrupt. If you must interrupt, frame it appropri-
ately—“Excuse me! I’m so sorry to interrupt, but I know we have a limited
amount of time, and I want to make sure we cover the topics we’re here to
learn about.”
Note
Conference Interruptus
I was at a conference in Bangalore. The last session of the day
included a fairly spirited Q&A. There were two microphones
going around, and while an audience member and a panel-
ist were going back and forth on one mic, I got the other. The
discussion was degrading; the audience member was fixated
on some issue and was not going to let it go, but there was no
resolution. The conversation had devolved into posturing and
deflection. People began to get annoyed and mutter and shift
in their seats. They saw me with the microphone and began,


Optimizing the Interview
123
quietly at first and then more insistently, to encourage me to
interrupt. I could see that interrupting was within the norm for
this culture, but even as I was standing up and being cheered
on, it was extremely difficult for me to interrupt. I succeeded in
opening my mouth, but nothing came out. Twice. Meanwhile,
the droning, time-wasting back-and-forth continued, and my
fellow attendees were losing patience with me. Finally, I was
able to interrupt, but it was a significant challenge, even with
all the affirmation! In an interview, I find interrupting just as dif-
ficult and do it only when I absolutely have to.
When You Feel Uncomfortable or Unsafe
Unless you are going to a public or familiar corporate location, don’t conduct
interviews on your own. When you arrive at a location, verify that everyone
feels safe. Pay attention to the difference between unsafe and uncomfortable1.
If you feel unsafe, don’t go in. If you feel uncomfortable, try to set that feeling
aside and proceed (see Figures 8.1 and 8.2).
Figure 8.1
Check your gut reaction. If you feel uncomfortable, it may still be
okay to proceed.
1	 See http://johnnyholland.org/2009/06/lets-embrace-open-mindedness/ (scroll down to
the section entitled “Getting Out of the Comfort Zone”) for some thoughts about acknowledg-
ing people’s discomfort in new or different situations). Coming to grips with this discomfort is
a wonderful way to grow as an interviewer.

124
Chapter 8
Figure 8.2
If you feel unsafe, pay attention to that feeling and stay away from
dangerous places.
There will be plenty of strange interviews. It’s an hour or two of your
life; if you aren’t in danger, do your best to learn what you need to learn,
acknowledge that life is interesting, and add the experience to your set of
war stories.2
Women are unfortunately more likely to encounter awkwardness and
comments that push the boundaries. If you feel increasing discomfort in
response to someone else’s behavior, take a moment to pause and identify
what’s happening. You might want to call for a bathroom break. If you are
at risk, leave. Otherwise, you can ignore the behavior (but not the person) or
restate your objectives and give the participant the opportunity to agree to
continue with that focus. Of course, be aware of your own limits and be pre-
pared to leave if the situation deteriorates.
2	 Danger is a personally subjective issue. In this video https://vimeo.com/9217883, Luis Arnal
describes his design-research adventures, including arranging with gang leaders to gain
access to Brazilian slums (know as favelas) for fieldwork, the consequences of inadvertently
photographing an FBI undercover operation, and (if not dangerous then perhaps uncomfort-
able) participating in one of Spencer Tunick’s massive nude photo shoots.

Note
The Minor Meltdown
After a long few days of fieldwork, my client and I headed to Los
Angeles’s Toy District to interview a wholesaler. Driving sepa-
rately, we had each struggled naïvely through traffic the way
that out-of-towners do and were searching for parking. I left my
car in a no-parking spot and went to verify our meeting location.
Our interview was with a small business owner. I was picturing a
typical retail setting, with a familiar storefront, street numbers,
etc. Instead, I found a street filled with stalls jammed with mer-
chandise, with few prominent building numbers (many were just
scrawled in marker on the outer edges of the stalls). Something
about this did not feel right, so I called our recruiter and got
confirmation that we were indeed in the right place.
I left my car in a lot and walked to meet my client, who was
still in his car, circling. I got into his car and related my impres-
sions as he navigated traffic, still looking for parking. The long
days, the daunting traffic, the unfamiliar surroundings, and
the parking problems had been accumulating until something
within him snapped. He turned red, made a sudden turn, and
floored the accelerator. Fortunately for me, his venting of emo-
tions gave me space to be “the calm one” (although no doubt
I had fed his anxiety with my own). We drove a few blocks, and
I made some very concrete suggestions about where to park.
Once calmness returned, we both could see that there was
nothing really wrong, but we had just reached the end of our
ropes. We got some food and walked back to our interview. We
were overwhelmed and exhausted, and the lack of familiarity
caused a brief and intense descent into fear. That experience
with the fight-or-flight reflex helped me more finely parse the
difference between discomfort and danger.
Interview Variations and Special Cases
While I’ve devoted much of this book to the optimal case where you and your
participant have arranged the best possible interview situation, there are
inevitably exceptions. In this section, I’ll look at how to deal with some of
these situations:
• You and your participant are not in the same location.
• You meet your participant in a neutral location, out of his context.
• You have only a short amount of time for the interview.
• You are interviewing people as “professionals” rather than as “consumers.”
• You have multiple participants in a single interview.

126
Chapter 8
When Your Interview Isn’t Face-to-Face
Phone interviews are a fairly common alternative to face-to-face interviews,
especially when geographic distance makes a face-to-face interview unre-
alistic. Since you won’t have as much context (see Figure 8.3), look for other
ways to compensate. Ask participants beforehand to send some digital photos
of their environment or to describe elements you won’t be able to see dur-
ing the call. When arranging the interview, establish their expected location.
(For example, will they be in their car in traffic, or will they be at home caring
for their children?) At the same time, confirm the length of the interview. For
most people, an hour is a long time to be on the phone.
During a phone interview, a lack of facial cues makes it a bit harder to adjust
your pace and rhythm to the participant. Experiment with giving your par-
ticipant an extra beat of silence to ensure she feels permitted to speak, and
to allow her to continue to speak. If silence is making her uncomfortable
(you get a, “Hello? Are you there?”), pick up the pace a bit and introduce ver-
bal handoffs (such as, “Go ahead…please continue…”).
If you use technologies like Skype (for audio or video) and FaceTime, you are
introducing other complicating factors:
• Your participant might not be fully proficient at using these tools. It’s
not ideal to begin the interview having your participant exasperated
and feeling incompetent.
• You are subject to the variability of Internet connection speeds (and
software reliability) on both ends. Four minutes of reconnecting and
dropping calls is not acceptable, so arrange for a technology test before
the interview.
Figure 8.3
When the interviewer and participant can’t see each other, it’s anyone’s guess
how their contexts differ.


Optimizing the Interview
127
• Not everyone is fully literate in video conferencing. Consider your audi-
ence. You might want to warm up the interview with a discussion of the
communication context (“It’s unfortunate we couldn’t meet with you
face-to-face. Do you regularly meet with people via Skype?”).
When Your Interview Is in a Market Research Facility
Focus group companies offer meeting rooms designed for market research,
with mirrored-wall observation rooms, video recording, and all the other
accoutrements. It would be a mistake to consider these facilities as neutral
third places. When you invite people to come to a facility to be interviewed,
they are coming to your house. Unfortunately, all the comfy couches, Nerf
balls, and tasty snacks don’t change that. You must be the host instead of
the guest. Even if you don’t feel settled in this new environment yourself, you
must welcome them into your space. You can ask them to bring something of
theirs (photos, artifacts, or a collage) to the interview, but this approach is a
definite compromise.
When Your Interview Is Very Short
If you can get only a short amount of time from people, warm them up ahead
of time. Get them thinking about your topics by emailing them some key
questions to think about. They don’t need to write up their answers ahead
of time; they can just be reflecting on these topics and be prepared to share
some perspective. You won’t have time to probe too much. Stick to the
agreed-upon time unless they offer to talk longer, and then make an explicit
request for a follow-up interview.
The Differences in Interviewing Professionals
vs. Consumers
Consumer interviews will probably take place in the home. When interview-
ing professionals, you might find yourself on a trading floor, in a hospital, in
a restaurant, in an office, in a manufacturing facility, or in any other kind of
environment. Professionals might have to perform their work tasks intermit-
tently or continuously as they are interviewed, so you might be doing bouts
of passive observation, or you might be asking for narration of processes
rather than exploring other topics. Depending on what you need to do when
interviewing professionals, you need to be very specific in your interview
request—duration, environment, role, and so on.
Consumers might default to treating your interview like a visit. Profession-
als often frame the interview as a meeting. You can choose to operate within
those expectations, or you can seek to shift them, but keep in mind where
your participant is coming from.

128
Chapter 8
Interviewing Multiple Participants
We often ask other family members to join interviews, or we may speak to
colleagues simultaneously when interviewing professionals. This is best
when you aren’t expecting power dynamics to significantly impact the inter-
view (such as a subordinate being asked to explain his career goals in front
of his boss; or a teen being asked about her alcohol consumption in front of
her parents). If need be, you can break the interview into separate chunks for
each participant individually and for the group together.
In terms of group dynamics, your goal should be to get the participants
talking extemporaneously, even to each other. Do not conduct two parallel
identical interrogations; instead, gently lead a conversation by throwing your
questions open and using eye contact and specific probes directed at individu-
als to encourage them to contribute. As you hold back, they will step forward.
Instead of this:
Interviewer: When did you start drinking Kombucha?
P1: About six months ago.
Interviewer: How about you, when did you start drinking Kombucha?
P2: It was about four months ago.
Interviewer: And what is it about Kombucha that draws you to it?
P1: I like the taste.
Interviewer: What about you?
P2: I like the way I feel after.
Aim for this:
Interviewer: When did you each start drinking Kombucha?
P1: About six months ago.
Interviewer: [Pause]
P2: Oh, for me it was about four months ago.
Interviewer: And what is it about Kombucha?
P1: I like the taste.
P2: You do? I actually can’t stand the taste but…I like the way I feel after.
P1: But tell them about what happened when you drank that tiny bottle
last week!


Optimizing the Interview
129
You’ll have more success with people who already know each other. As I
mentioned earlier when considering the number of interviewers, people
influence each other simply by being together.3 The more people you include,
the more you’ll experience that effect.
Using Different Interviewing Techniques at
Different Points in the Development Process
Regardless of your business objectives, you always want to understand how
the participant makes sense of the world, and what problems and concerns
they have. You may be early in the development process and have broad
questions, or you may be further along and have hypotheses (concepts, ani-
mations, storyboards, designs, wireframes, and more). In the latter case,
spend the first part of the interview understanding the participant’s work-
flow, objectives, pain points, and so on. Then, when you share the artifacts
you’ve brought, you have a better chance at understanding why they are
responding the way they do. If you aren’t interested in that amount of detail
and just want reactions to your prototype, you’re better off doing usability
testing, not interviews.
Improving as an Interviewer
Now that you’ve learned some techniques for interviewing, you can hone and
refine your performance further by practicing, reflecting, critiquing, collect-
ing, and sharing.
Practice
Don’t forget that interviewing is like any skill: the more you practice, the
better you get. Even the busiest researcher only gets to do a certain number
of interviews, so be creative in generating or finding other opportunities to
practice. Take advantage of brief everyday encounters (say, that loquacious
taxi driver) and do a little bit of interviewing, asking questions and follow-up
questions. Cultivate a style of interacting socially that emphasizes listening,
reflecting back the other person’s comments, allowing for silence, and so on.
Try for longer and deeper conversations to build up your stamina.
When you are in the field, remember that each interview is also a learning
experience. Try something different once in a while. Use the interview guide
from back to front while still maintaining rapport and keeping a comfort-
able flow; force yourself to count to five before everything you say; don’t just
take notes, take copious notes.

org/wiki/Normative_social_influence for more.

130
Chapter 8
Reflect
You can get the most out of any interview by reflecting on it. Football
coaches review game films, and user researchers can do similarly. You have
the material: audio, video, or transcripts. Otherwise, conduct and capture
mock interviews specifically for this purpose. Look for moments that went
well or moments that went slightly awry and think about what you would do
differently. Don’t beat yourself up about how you handled it in the moment;
the benefit of reflection is that you can stop time and consider a range
of options.
Seek out opportunities to be interviewed yourself. Although phone sur-
veys or online customer satisfaction surveys use a different methodology,
the participants aren’t thinking about that; they are just being asked ques-
tions. Sign up for market research databases or volunteer for grad student
studies. Go through the experience and notice when it feels bad (and any-
time it feels right). You can use these insights to avoid, or replicate, such
interview techniques.
Leverage your past experiences with strangers, such as going on blind dates,
working as a bartender or waiter, being interviewed for a job, and more.
What principles did you develop in those situations? Consider what worked
and what didn’t and why.
Critique
In addition to reviewing your own interviews, review other people’s, too (and
ask them to review yours). Tag along during interviews and watch someone’s
technique. Teach someone else how to lead an interview. Or ask someone to
come along to your interviews and get his feedback. Also ask for feedback
from the rest of your field team (even if you are the lead interviewer), or even
from your research participants.
Check out interviews in the media: Terry Gross, Charlie Rose, Barbara
Walters, Oprah Winfrey, and Marc Maron are good places to start (see Fig-
ure 8.4). Watch and listen as an interviewer, not just an audience member.
Although the context of journalism (writ large) differs from user research,
you will notice techniques both new and familiar.

And More
Collect and share your fieldwork war stories.4 These experiences—the crazy
household, the dog that does his business on your shoes, the GPS failure—
are inevitable and are often hilarious (at least in hindsight). Exchanging
these stories is a way of sharing techniques and creates learning opportuni-
ties for both the tellers and listeners.5 A culture of exchange—wherever you
can find it—is going to help you grow your own skills. You can check out (and
contribute to) a growing archive of fieldwork war stories at www.portigal.
com/series/WarStories.
4	 As in this Merriam-Webster definition: “A recounting of a memorable personal experience,
especially one involving challenge, hardship, danger, or other interesting features.”
5	 In Per Brandström’s thesis Boundless Universe: The Culture of Expansion Among the Sukuma-
Nyamwezi of Tanzania, he describes how anthropologists in the field often gather at a hotel bar
and “release a torrent of stories about bizarre and remarkable happenings and experiences
in exotic settings, and each anthropologist will try and top the others’ wildest stories... When
the laughter dies away and the entertainer is transformed into the scientist, a sudden change
of scene has taken place. The anecdotes and the wild stories are stowed away. Now order is the
rule of the day; facts and theories will be presented.”

Chapter 8
Take an improv class. Improv training helps develop many aspects of
interviewing, such as being in the moment, holding back judgment, and lis-
tening.6 Alternatively, meditation can help you be present during interviews
and develop the mental energy it takes to focus deeply on someone else.
Connect with other interviewers online7 and at conferences.8 Read books
about interviewing (Hey, you’re doing that right now! Well done!) and about
interpersonal communication.9 As you learn more, you can identify your
own personal style and adjust for it.

Optimizing the Interview
133
Summary
Interviewing is made of people, and as such your experiences in the
field will be unpredictable and surprising. Be prepared for what might
go awry and how you will deal with it.
• If you feel your participant is reticent, be sure it’s not just a dif-
ference between her speaking rhythm and yours. Try to identify
what’s making her uncomfortable and make adjustments. If
necessary, ask about any possible discomfort. Or just accept the
awkwardness and move forward until she opens up.
• You may not initially feel a participant is right for the study.
Once you are there interviewing, stick with it. If he isn’t what you
expected (despite deliberate screening), that is something worth
reflecting on later; meanwhile, what can you learn from him now?
• If you think your participant is talking too much, ask yourself if
that’s because you are feeling out of control or because you aren’t
getting the information you want. If you must interrupt, apologize
and remind him that you value his limited time.
• In a phone interview, lack of visual cues makes it harder to adjust
your pace and rhythm to the participant. Give her an extra beat
and give yourself permission to feel awkward in those small
moments of silence or overlap.
• If you have only a very brief amount of time for your interview,
prime your participant ahead of time with some questions or top-
ics you plan to discuss.
• When interviewing several people at once, avoid asking each per-
son the same question in turn. Use eye contact to create a more
free-flowing dialogue where some questions are addressed to an
individual while others are thrown to the group. Allow them to
follow-up each other’s points and even ask each other questions.
• Be aware of the difference between discomfort and fearing for your
safety. Develop a tolerance for the former but do not compromise
on the latter.
• Improve your interviewing skills by practicing, varying from your
habitual approach, reviewing transcripts and videos, and seeking
critiques from others.

Chapter 9
A
lthough I’ve necessarily dwelled on the details of the interview, as the
book comes to a close, it makes sense to step back and revisit why
you’re conducting the interviews. It’s not only to learn about people,
but also to take the information back to the organization in a way that it can
be acted upon. You want to be sure that data becomes insights, and insights
become opportunities—for new products, features, services, designs, and
strategies, but also new opportunities for teams to embrace a user-centered
approach to their work.
So what happens with all this great data? Although analysis and synthesis
(not to mention design) easily merit their own books, in this chapter I’ll pro-
vide an overview of a process you can use to sort through all your data.
Analyzing and Synthesizing
Your Interview Data
Working with research data is a combination of analysis, or breaking
larger pieces into smaller ones (for example, interviews and transcripts
into anecdotes and stories) and synthesis, or combining multiple pieces
into something new (for example, building themes, implications, and
opportunities).
This combination of analysis and synthesis is part of the iterative process of
working through the data. Although multiple iterations are beneficial, the
two steps that are most important are:
• Informally processing the experiential data in your head from having
conducted all the interviews
• More rigorously diving into the documented data (the notes, videos,
photos, transcripts, and so on)
In Chapter 7, I described debriefs and field highlights. These are two ways
that you begin the analysis and synthesis process during fieldwork. After
you’ve finished gathering data, you should compile a starter set with
anywhere from 5 to 15 thematic areas that build on these debriefs and high-
lights and address the research objectives. You may also have some clues
about new patterns. At this stage, you’re really only processing the experi-
ence of being in the field. Given that fact, it’s appropriate to simply identify
interesting areas and provocative questions, such as, “There seems to be a
relationship between people’s comfort with making mistakes and their use
of different companies’ productions.” You don’t need to know what the rela-
tionship actually is at this point; instead, you are just noting patterns and
weak signals (a term from electrical engineering that has been adopted by
futurists) that you see.

137
Create a Topline Report
This set of emerging themes and early findings becomes a topline report.
See the example in the sidebar that follows. (You can see the whole report at
http://rfld.me/UoGeOw.) Determine what provokes your client’s interest
(and where you might encounter skepticism) in order to bring focus to your
next steps.
In the introduction to the topline, I included the following statements:
Topline is based on early impressions, not formal analysis of
data. This is a chance to share stories and initial insights from the
fieldwork; to discuss what jumped out at us and list questions we
still have.
An introduction like this helps set the expectations for the client team. My
clients sometimes tell me they are afraid their colleagues will take early
findings and dash off to implementation, so I work hard to clarify where we
are in the process. I include key milestones from the overall project calendar
where I can point to what is coming next, how future deliverables will be dif-
ferent than what’s in the topline, and when they can expect them.
I create topline reports in Microsoft Word. A Word document is more for-
malized than an email but less formal than a PowerPoint presentation,
and this is the balance I’m trying to strike. Ongoing dialogue is usually in
email; the final presentation is in PowerPoint. This deliverable is right in the
middle. I want enough formality that the appearance of the topline is appro-
priate to a milestone in the project (that’s the conclusion of full-on fieldwork
and the transition into full-on analysis and synthesis), but with enough
looseness that the content isn’t misinterpreted to be more conclusive or
actionable than is warranted.
Deeply Processing Your Data
After the topline report comes the more formal data processing stage. This
is important because this step is where you will uncover significant new
insights that go well beyond the topline. You will get your data in text form
and divide it among the team. This typically includes everyone who went in
the field and optionally others who were available for this part of the pro-
cess. But don’t spread the data too thinly; people do best if they have at least
two or three interviews to work with. Make sure that each interview has
been assigned to a team member.

Chapter 9
Sample of Reading Ahead 1 Topline Report

## Reading is not just a solo activity; there are significant social/interpersonal


aspects for many people.
• Recommendations, book clubs, lending
• Books facilitate the interpersonal aspects of reading:
• Can be easily lent or given away
• Can be given as gifts
• People can use a book together: parents and kids, showing someone
a passage or illustrations, and so on
• Reading can be a big part of family life
• Childhood memories, passing books between generations, reading with
one’s own children
• Connection between home life and outside world (school)

## Reading and books are not always one and the same.


• Erica buys some books because she likes them as objects. She knows
she might not read all of them. “I love books. I almost like books more
than reading.”
• Jeff says if you love to read, you’d like the Kindle. If you love books,
you should try it out before you buy one.
• The Kindle facilitates types of reading beyond books: blogs, articles,
and periodicals.

## Books do more than carry content.


• Books engage the senses—they are tactile, visual objects, with specific
characteristics like smell and weight.
• They become carriers of specific memories
• They develop a patina that carries meaning
• An inscribed book becomes a record of an event, interaction,
or relationship

• There is an art/collector aspect to books, which is absent on the Kindle.
• First editions
• Signed copies
• Galley proofs
• Typography
• Pictures and illustrations
• Quality of paper, printing, and so on
• Books say something about a person.
• Others can see what you’re reading; like clothes and other belongings,
this carries meaning
• “Looking at someone’s bookshelves when you go to their house” (Jeff)
• When people give books as gifts, they are deliberately communicat-
ing something about the relationship, the event, themselves, and
the recipient
• Books can create a physical record of someone’s reading activity.
• Chris used to line up all the books he had read to get a sense of
accomplishment
• Annotations, bookmarks, and tags convey the reader’s personal history
with that book

## Books are easily shared.


• Pass them along to others
• Donate to library
• Sell or buy at a used bookstore
• Borrow from the library rather than purchase

Anna Lorenzetto, design anthropology graduate student,
Swinburne University of Technology
Each team member should go through his portion of the transcripts quickly,
making short marginal notes on patterns, key quotes, or whatever seems
interesting (see Figure 9.1). These notes can be in the form of labels (“This is
another example of BLURRING BOUNDARIES”), questions (“Where did she
get this process?”), or even hypothesized solutions (“They really need that
all-in-one robot here!”).
The group should then reconvene and present each interview as a case
study. You can give a bit of background about the individual, and then page
through your marginal notes and pick out the provocative highlights. Dis-
cuss each interview briefly, and then create a sticky note that summarizes
the key point of that interview. Each case study will take about an hour on
average. As you are accumulating stickies, take a few moments to create
groupings. You may want to start with the categories from your topline and
add to them. As you assemble those groupings, you will collectively begin to
develop a new, shared point of view that goes beyond the mere findings.

Figure 9.2
In analysis/synthesis sessions, stories and examples from transcripts and other
data are synthesized into key findings, takeaways, and opportunities.
A precise articulation of that point of view, including the implications for
business and design, becomes the Presentation of Findings, which is the main
research deliverable. The specifics will obviously depend on your research
question as well as the makeup of your team and stakeholders.
The transcript of a two-hour interview might run 35 pages, and with a bit
of practice in skimming and annotating, you can get through it in under an
hour. Presenting the first few interviews to the group will take a very long
time, because everything is new and everything is interesting. By the time
you get to the end, you’ll be moving much more quickly. Plan for a series of
3–4 hour sessions (see Figure 9.2) and expect to average about an hour per
interview. Of course, there are more opportunities for synthesis as you trans-
form your results into some form of deliverable.
Research as a Leadership Activity
When I give seminars or workshops about the methods and techniques
you’ve been reading about in this book, I’m frequently asked to address the
challenges facing people who are not only interested in learning these meth-
ods but also are passionate about advocating for this approach. The best
practices outlined in this section are based on what I’ve seen my clients do,
as well as insights I’ve gleaned from interviews with a number of thought
leaders working inside large organizations in industry.

142
Chapter 9
Championing the Use of Research in Your Organization
You should position yourself in your organization so that interviewing
customers is an integral part of how you work. If this wasn’t part of your
arrangement upon being hired, you need to evolve your brand with your
managers and colleagues. If you can’t do that, consider your future in that
organization. If your values are not aligned, ask yourself how feasible it
is to shift their values versus finding another job where your approach
is welcomed.
If your employer has a fast-follower strategy, your plan to use insights to
drive breakthrough offerings is unlikely to succeed. Look at Jess McMullin’s
Design Maturity Model in Figure 9.3 and identify where your organization
is today (and where it’s going). You might suggest, for example, that in order
to do something new in the market, you have to do something new with your
process, but if management doesn’t want to do something new in the mar-
ket, your argument will fall on deaf ears.

Making an Impact with Your Research
143
Identify allies who will advocate for the kind of research you want to do.
You may find newly hired leaders who believe in certain best practices from
previous jobs, or isolated designers and researchers elsewhere in the cor-
poration who are looking for their own peers and champions, or managers
who know there must be a better way to reach users but don’t know where to
start. Reach out to the professional community for mentors, inspiration, and
peer support, and to benchmark your successes against others.
If you are getting pushback about interviewing users, identify the objec-
tion and target your proposal accordingly. If you’re being told that the team
already knows what they need to design, is that true? If so, why haven’t pre-
vious initiatives succeeded? Take time to understand the problem you are
being asked to solve. What has already been tried? What worked and what
didn’t work? Base your recommendations on that context. You aren’t asking
for permission here; you are making a case for solving their problem.
If there is concern about resources, be aware of what it takes to do this sort
of research (see Figure 9.4 for a typical timeline), and if you want to tighten
the deadlines, be aware—and make sure your stakeholders are aware—of
the trade-offs of doing so (see Figure 9.5). Sometimes resistance to commit-
ting resources is based on naïve assumptions about what is necessary (such
as, “We have to see every type of customer.”). Your expertise in project plan-
ning will help scope the project appropriately. Determine the research needs
and propose the right size project that will address them, highlighting costs
and trade-offs.

144
Chapter 9
Figure 9.5
Working with tighter deadlines means making trade-offs.
Help your organization understand that interviewing users is a special skill,
beyond the general process of “talking to people.” Training, delivered by you
or by an external specialist, will reveal user research as a special skill, and
will empower more people to go out and interview users. You shouldn’t just
be looking for opportunities to do user research yourself; you should be try-
ing to get the company to embrace this overall approach. When partnering
with external research vendors, highlight their relevant expertise (mobile,
teen media consumption, medical, and so on).
Be proactive in identifying opportunities to learn about users. Instead of
waiting for requests (which are likely to be more tactical than strategic), look
for design questions and business questions and propose research that will
serve multiple teams and initiatives.
For example, when a client repeatedly approached me with requests for
proposals on similar studies (“How are tech-forward individuals managing
their digital music?” “How are tech-forward households streaming media
between devices?” “How are tech-forward people using mobile?”), I sug-
gested an alternative approach, investigating instead their “digital daily
lives.” This proposal went all the way to the CEO, who was reportedly excited
about it, but then instead reorganized their design, research, and innovation
teams. While the consulting project never materialized, I believe we helped
catalyze an overdue discussion about team structure and process.
Maximizing Research Impact
To maximize the impact of the research you do, be sure to engage the orga-
nization throughout the process, from setting the research agenda, to the
detailed planning and joining you in the field. Members of the organization
can be involved in the analysis and synthesis activities, from the topline
through reading transcripts and identifying patterns and themes.


Making an Impact with Your Research
145
The most impact for the least effort comes from your colleagues joining
you in the field. When managed properly (see Chapter 5, “Key Stages of the
Interview”), even a single interview can show individuals that how the orga-
nization has been thinking about user needs is incomplete. For some teams,
this engagement is ultimately more powerful than any traditional research
output. Creating alignment and revising entrenched belief structures are
two higher-order benefits that come from research. They help position user
research as an essential strategic tool.
Make your process visible. When a client couldn’t get a meeting room for a
massive fieldwork debriefing, he took over the kitchen area. Many people
walked by and peeked in, intrigued, to see what was happening.
Articulate research findings in ways that are most relevant to your stake-
holders. Will you have the most impact by telling stories, defining needs,
specifying requirements, or producing prototypes? One research team real-
ized that results like “Users need it to be easy to clean” were not actionable by
their internal customers. They evolved their process to articulate specifically
what the engineers should do, with recommendations like “Surfaces should be
made from elastomeric materials and all joining pieces should have no more
than a 1mm gap.” User research starts to look like design, doesn’t it?2
I saw more blurring between research and design in another group that added
a team member who was highly skilled at rapidly creating high-fidelity pro-
totypes for developers. Research findings were delivered in exactly the right
form that the internal customer needed.
Increase the visibility of your outputs. Look for as many possible audiences
and venues to share your results. One of my clients took the deliverable we
developed together and gave 30 presentations over a few months. Another
team mounted an ever-growing number of user profile posters on the walls
around their workspace (see Figure 9.6).
One researcher working on medical equipment did his prototyping at his
desk instead of in a lab, and found that coworkers stopped by to investigate
his progress. Another client of mine built a “museum” from our research in
Japan that included miscellaneous consumer items and household equip-
ment, pamphlets and advertisements, photographs, and printed pages from
our research report. This display was in place for over a year and prompted
conversations for years beyond that.

Field teams created profile posters, telling an engaging, visual story

Make sure that you have plenty of face time with the teams that will use your
research. Spend some time each week in their location, if it’s different than
yours. Sit in on meetings, even if you aren’t “invited.” Share the user insights
you already have that can inform their decisions and be on the lookout for
opportunities to gather additional insights. The more you conduct deep and
revealing interviews that drive the organization’s thinking, the more impact
you can have on almost everything in that organization. Good luck!
Summary
The emphasis here has been on gathering data in the field, but obvi-
ously we are doing that in order to do something with it: to unpack
insights and turn them into opportunities for our teams to design new
and better products and services. We also want to inform and inspire
the organization with a richer and more nuanced perspective about the
people we are serving.
• Working with research data is a combination of analysis (breaking
larger pieces into smaller ones) and synthesis (combining multiple
pieces into something new).
• From the experience you’ve had conducting the interviews, orga-
nize your initial takeaways into a topline report.
• Use the topline report to get early feedback from your team about
what the research is starting to reveal. Uncover what insights may
be challenging to accept and which ones are exciting. Use this
intelligence to guide your deeper analysis.
• Divide up transcripts among team members. Review interviews
and annotate transcripts to highlight insights, patterns, and
quotes. Get the team back together and present interviews as case
studies. Capture main points on sticky notes. Cluster stickies and
write up your report.
• If your organization is resistant to interviewing users, identify the
types of resistance you are facing, from cultural to resource (or
other). Develop your response appropriately.
• Nothing sells like success. Leverage every bit of research you do to
create opportunities for more research.

Acknowledgments
The ne plus ultra of thanks is due to my family, for believing in the best of me
and for their happiness for every bit of good stuff that comes my way. Such
support is the sine qua non for my success. Thank you Anne, Sharna, Cheryl,
Bruce, Talia, Ari, and Brody!
Going back decades, Tom Williams was there with me as we both began to
“figger out” this whole user research thing. While we were initially focused
on learning and doing, we eventually began teaching others (discendo dis-
cimus!), and many of my frameworks today emerged from that formative
period. Even earlier, folks like Susan Wolfe and Marilyn Tremaine saw poten-
tial and pushed me to reach it.
For the genesis of this (and precursors), thanks are due to Deborah Rodg-
ers, Dan Szuc, and Peter March. Ultimately, the biggest cheerleader for this
project was Lou Rosenfeld, someone who transmutes cacoethes scribendi
into fun and profit. During the writing, Lou’s guidance and mentorship were
invaluable, and my editor Marta Justak was a tireless and savvy source of
advice, encouragement, compliments, and reassurance. Karen Corbett was
there to make things happen when they needed to happen!
Right out of the gate, I found support from Elizabeth Goodman, Andrea
Moed, Stefanie Norvaisas, and Marc Rettig, who happily agreed to serve as
advisers, a role that neither they nor I fully grasped, and one I probably failed
to sufficiently utilize. Still, coniunctis viribus!
David Hoard, Veronica Stuart, and Andrew Harder graciously served as tech-
nical reviewers. They read an early draft, and each contributed a colossal
cornucopia of comments, calls for clarification, challenges, and compliments.
A whole heap of folks helped out with information, answers to questions,
referrals, permission, content, or other succor. No doubt I’m forgetting quite
a few (mea culpa!), but at least I know to thank Jennifer Ackerman, Kavita
Appachu, Genevieve Bell, Jerry Birenz, Lena Blackstock, Harry Boadwee,
Nate Bolt, Carla Borsoi, Al Bredenberg, Jan Chipchase, Tamara Christensen,
Allan Chochinov, Elizabeth Churchill, Yohan Creemers, Anke de Jong,
