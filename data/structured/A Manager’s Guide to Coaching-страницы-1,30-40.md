Instead of focusing on individual development, your attention with group coaching is on improving relationships and interactions within the team as a whole. Team coaching is useful in many situations. For

example, it can help people to: •	 Work through interpersonal conflicts. •	 Understand their roles within the group. •	 Improve relationships. •	 Understand team goals. You can coach your people at a specific place and

time – at a team-building event, for example – or you can do it spontaneously. In this chapter, we discuss some of the causes of conflict within teams, and the tools that you can use to resolve it. We also examine the importance

of defining your expectations, and how to manage clashes of values in cross-functional teams. It’s not easy to get a team to work to its full potential. Conflicts, power struggles and miscommunication can cause a group to start, stumble and stop.

you need to know how your people relate to one another. Each person has a unique personality and way of communicating. But, when people are in a group, they have to work closely with one another. Their

different styles can cause frustration and conflict, which may prevent them from working together effectively. By understanding team dynamics, you can help people to recognize how they relate to one another,

and to identify ways to improve their relationships. Recognizing Unique Personalities Personality tests such as Myers-Briggs®, the Big Five Personality Traits Model, and The DiSC Model can help you and your team members to learn more

about how you prefer to communicate and process information. If your team members agree to take these tests, and to share the results, they may learn to understand one another better, and that it’s OK for individuals

to have different preferences. This can enable them to work together more effectively. Let’s look at an example. Patrick is detail-oriented, and enjoys compiling facts and doing research. This sometimes annoys his colleagues, because

they think he can be too slow to finish his work. But, when they realize the benefit that the team gets from his attention to detail, they begin to see it as a strength rather than a weakness. It can also help if each team member understands

her “role” within the group, and whether it’s Action Oriented, People Oriented or Thought Oriented. The nine specific roles that underpin team success were identified in the 1970s by Dr Meredith Belbin,

and you can learn about them in our article, Belbin’s Team Roles. How to Coach: a Manager’s Guide Page 32 of 58 ACTION Ask your team members to identify their strengths in relation to the team as a whole. Then, read about

Belbin’s team roles and pick the role that you think each team member plays within your group. List them in the table, below. Team Member 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. Strengths Role How to Coach: a Manager’s Guide

Page 33 of 58 Another useful technique for matching and balancing team roles and individual preferences is the Margerison-McCann Team Management Profile. This tool is similar to Belbin’s Team Roles, and is based on the same principles: that people

have different strengths, and that a well-balanced team includes a variety of preference types. 3.2. Defining Your Expectations When your team members understand one another better, they will likely work together more

effectively. But they may also benefit from a set of ground rules that guides the way that they behave and communicate. ​For instance, let’s say that Rudi finds high-energy meetings exhausting and intimidating. He’s also the

technical expert. The group needs to know when it’s veering off course, and Rudi’s input is crucial. But, it’s difficult for him to speak up against the group. In the past, he has stayed silent when he

could have raised the alarm, and this has damaged the team’s reputation. This highlights the importance of defining your expectations regarding behavior and communication. In our example, you would tell

Rudi that he needs to give clearer guidance to the group, and to speak up when he knows that things are going wrong. You can set out your expectations in a team charter. This is a document that defines the behavior and

communication “rules” that everyone in the group is expected to follow and support. If a written charter isn’t appropriate, you can discuss and agree acceptable standards of behavior for different situations with your team members. For

example, you might talk about how to manage conflict, and what to do if someone isn’t pulling her weight. ACTION Prepare a team charter by answering the questions below and on the next page. 1. What are your team’s mission and objectives? What is your most important goal?

How to Coach: a Manager’s Guide Page 34 of 58 2. What is each person’s role on your team? What is his unique expertise or skill? 3. Who is the team leader? 4. What kind of behavior do you expect from your people? What will you not tolerate? Outline your

expectations, below. How to Coach: a Manager’s Guide Page 35 of 58 5. List each person’s responsibilities and what he is expected to deliver, below: Name 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Responsibility Outcome Priority 6. Give each responsibility listed above a score between one and five, with one as the highest priority and

five as the lowest. 7. What power does your team have on its own? What does it need permission to do? Write this below. 8. What is your team’s budget? What do you do if you need additional funds? Write this process, below.

How to Coach: a Manager’s Guide Page 36 of 58 9. What resources and support are available to your team? Team Members’ Feedback ACTION When you have completed your team charter, give everyone a copy and schedule a meeting to

talk about its contents. Ask for your team’s input, and write down these ideas in the box, below. How to Coach: a Manager’s Guide Page 37 of 58 3.3. Evaluating Rewards and Recognition At times, people in your team might have

competing priorities, and this can lead to serious dysfunction within the group. For instance, your organization might promote teamwork but reward individual performance. So, what happens when some people put their

personal goals before those of the team, to get recognition or a bonus? Here’s another example: in a cross-functional team, each member has goals and priorities within the group, as well as from their “home” departments.

Conflict can arise if these objectives are at odds. As a manager, it’s important to identify any competing values or goals in your team, and to address them before they cause problems. How to Coach: a Manager’s Guide

Page 38 of 58 ACTION Answer the questions below to determine whether your team is facing any competing priorities. 1. Look at how your organization recognizes and rewards good performance. Does the system clash with the

goals and objectives of your own team? If so, how can you resolve this conflict? 2. If you’re leading a cross-functional team, look at the reward system within each department. Are there any conflicts?

## Make a list of your team goals, as well as each person’s objectives. Are they aligned? If not, where is the mismatch? How to Coach: a Manager’s Guide Page 39 of 58 3.4. Team Coaching Processes There are various models that you can use when


you coach a group, and some of the models that we outlined in Chapter 2 can also apply to team coaching. Here are some further suggestions: 1.  The POSITIVE Model of Coaching The POSITIVE Model of Coaching was developed

by Vincenzo Libri in 2004. You can use it to establish highly motivating goals for your team. The model has eight steps: •	 Purpose – Decide what you want to achieve. What is your goal? •	 Observations – Think about your situation.

What is going well? What isn’t? •	 SMART – Set a SMART goal (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time Bound). •	 Insight – Consider your goal. Are you excited about it? Is it challenging? •	 Team – Look at the people around you. Who

else will support you in achieving your goal? •	 Initiate – When will you start to work on your goal? How will you begin? How long will you spend on it each week? •	 Value – Break the goal down into smaller steps

and quick wins. How will the team celebrate success? •	 Encourage – Meet your team members regularly to encourage them, and to address any difficulties that they encounter. Use the POSITIVE Model when your team needs

to stay motivated to achieve long-term goals. Note, however, that the framework is less effective for dealing with issues such as interpersonal conflicts. 2.  The PRACTICE Model of Coaching The PRACTICE Model of Coaching was published

by psychologist Stephen Palmer in 2008, and is based on an earlier approach developed by Barbara Wasik. You can use this simple framework to enable your team to identify a problem, and to decide on a solution. The seven steps are:

## Evaluate. The biggest advantage of this model is that it’s solution-focused. Unlike the POSITIVE Model, it’s best for dealing with specific problems. TIP Use the PRACTICE model next time your team has a particular issue or problem that you want


to address. How to Coach: a Manager’s Guide Page 40 of 58 3.5. Drawing This Together In this chapter, we learned how coaching can enable your team to perform to its full potential. Team coaching concentrates on interactions

and relationships that help people to work better together, rather than on individual development. Keep in mind that coaching is really nothing more than a focused conversation. And, while it can be helpful to plan a group coaching session,

don’t forget to take advantage of “on the fly” conversations at the end of a team meeting, or during a group lunch, for example. The next chapter focuses on another good use for many of the skills and techniques that you’ve

learned so far – coaching yourself! ACTION What issues do you have with your team that you could resolve with coaching? How could it help? Write down your ideas, below. Issue 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. Resolution
