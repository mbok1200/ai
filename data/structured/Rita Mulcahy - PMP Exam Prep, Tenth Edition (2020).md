History of This Book
The ﬁrst edition of Rita Mulcahy’s Jl-T'i'vLF”Er Exam Prep was published in 1998, and at the time, it was the
ﬁrst and only comprehensive resource dedicated to PMP exam preparation.
As a project manager in the late 19905—as well as one of the world’s ﬁrst certiﬁed PMPs—Rita was
frustrated by the lack of quality PMP preparation materials available to her and her colleagues. So,
combining her knowledge of accelerated learning with her extensive project management experience, Rita
wrote the ﬁrst draft of PMP‘E’ Exam Prep. Since then, the popularity of the book has grown immensely,
through ten wildly successful editions. Today, the book is by far the best—selling PMP exam preparation
guide in the world, with thousands of copies in circulation.
Tragically, Rita passed away on May 15, 2010. RMC continues her mission today with the tenth edition
of the PMPG Exam Prep book, and with a growing line of other project-management-related courses and
products that promote her vision of improving the world through effective project management. PIMPEr
Exam Prep and its related products are used as study tools by many project managers across the globe, and
in hundreds of classroom-based prep classes at universities, training companies, and corporations.

Introduction to the Tenth Edition
Welcome to the tenth edition of PMP‘E’ Exam Prep. It’s been 20 years since Rita published the ﬁrst
edition of this book. WC has come far since the publication of the ﬁrst edition back in 1998, as has the
project management profession.
Back when the ﬁrst edition was published, most project managers were in the United States. Now
there are more international project managers than ever before. As a result of this industry growth, RMC’s
best—selling materials are now sold all over the world.
Project management is also a more complex profession than it used to be. Along with the processes,
concepts, tools, and techniques that were added within the last couple of years, there are now just as many
adaptive approaches to project management as there are predictive. The general methodologies and overall
practices of project management have changed dramatically, which has increased the size of a project
manager’s toolbox.
These updates have resulted in changes to the exam. There is more to learn today than ever. This
increased complexity is reﬂected in the tenth edition of our best—selling PMP Exam Prep book.
First, and one of the more signiﬁcant changes, is the introduction of three new domains within which
project management exists: People (Domain I), Process (Domain II), and Business Environment (Domain
III). What does this mean for the process groups of initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and
controlling, and closing? That’s a great question, and we have you covered. Our new and improved chapter
three, now titled ”Processes and Domains,” addresses both the process groups as well as each of the three
domains in a clear and easy—to—read format that will prepare you to not only understand the groups and
domains, but will give you all of the knowledge you need to pass the exam.
Another big change is the acknowledgement of the importance of PMI’s Examination Content Outline
(ECO). It is now more important than ever to read and understand the ECO as it covers the domains and
introduces adaptive approaches to project management and the PMP exam. Throughout each chapter of
the tenth edition of this book, we’ve included agile terms and concepts. You may see these terms and
concepts on the exam, but you also need to know them to become a more adaptive project manager.
While these are signiﬁcant changes, important aspects of our book remain the same. First, and most
importantly, is the conversational tone of the book. The tenth edition maintains its down-to-earth
conversational style—explaining things simply and clearly. Students say that when they read this book, it
feels like Rita is talking to them. In many ways, she still is.
Another thing that remains the same is our continued commitment to helping our students not only
pass the exam but also become better project managers. That is what the book, and, in fact, our company, is
all about.
As you read this book, know that our plan is not to have you memorize a bunch of rules and formulas
just to pass the exam and then promptly forget them. For one thing, given the situational nature of most
questions on the exam these days, we believe that such an approach would be unsuccessful. For another, it’s
not what we’re about. This book is not just a prep guide—it’s a learning tool. Ifyou master the contents of
our book, you will pass the exam, but it’s more than that. After you learn what we have to teach, you’ll be a
better project manager. At the end of the day, that’s what the world needs. Still, our goal with this book is to
get you to pass the exam on the ﬁrst try.
I couldn’t allow this book to go out the door without acknowledging the efforts of the team at RNIC
that made this happen. In particular, I’d like to thank Mike Gri r”’Iths, Margo Kirwin, Levi Satterlee, and Tori
Turnquist for their dedication and hard work on this edition.

XIV
Margo served as our leading subject matter expert. In addition to being an outstanding trainer, Margo
has an extensive background in instructional design, which she brought to the development of this edition.
She is also a talented writer who was able to maintain the conversational tone and feel of the book while
working hard tn explain all the elements of project management in a clear and easy—to—read way.
Mike Gri ”iths was also an important subject matter expert for this edition. Mike has a broad
background in agile and is the author of RMC’s PMI-ACP Exam Prep book, the best-selling resource for
passing the PMI—ACP exam. Mike was able to work and collaborate directly with the project team to ensure
our new content speciﬁc to agile would not only meet the needs of our students but properly prepare
someone to pass the new PMP exam on their ﬁrst try. Needless to say, Mike was a vital resource in creating
this book and we couldn’t have done it without him.
Finally, there is Tori, who served as the project manager and content editor for this update. In addition
to being a fantastic writer, Tori brought an incomparable set of skills that allowed her to help develop and
edit content with our subject matter experts while also managing the constantly moving pieces of the
project. Without her, this book would not have been published on time, if at all.
When Rita created RMC, she did so to help people. That is still our goal and one of the driving values
of this company. So enjoy the book, learn, and have fun.
What are you waiting for? Go get ‘em.

Tricks of the Trade® for
Studying for This Exam
O N E
Preparing to take the PM]? exam is a journey. Ifyou let it, this journey can help you grow your career and
develop your skills and abilities. This isn’t just about passing an exam—you can and will become a better
project manager. This opportunity to learn is one of the best reasons to get your PMP certiﬁcation.
To pass the PMP exam, you cannot simply cram a lot of information into your brain and try to retain
it just long enough to get through the test. You need to truly understand the process of project management
and what value that process can bring to your projects. The PMP exam is designed to prove your knowledge
and experience in applying the art and science of project management.
In addition to the learning opportunity, there can also be ﬁnancial incentives for passing the exam. A
salary survey conducted by the Project Management Institute (PMI‘E’) found that PIMP-certiﬁed project
managers, across all countries surveyed, are paid on average 25 percent more than those without the
certiﬁcation. RMC has had students who received a bonus, a raise, or both when they passed the exam.
Others have reported they were offered a job when hundreds of other qualiﬁed candidates had applied,
simply because they were PMP certiﬁed. Having a PMP certiﬁcation can be the reason you get a job, keep
your job, or are promoted.
Qualifying to Take the Exam
To take the PMP exam, you must meet the requirements outlined by PMI. The current requirements are
summarized in the following table. Requirements are subject to change, so make sure you review the
requirements at pmi.org.
Afour-year degree

I A high school diploma or an associaﬁiss

Keep in mind that just because you qualify on paper to take the exam doesn’t mean you’ll pass it. You
must know project management and have experience applying it—this includes both managing and
leading. Consider taking PMI’s CritPMG exam if you don't meet the requirements listed in the previous
table. You can ﬁnd the requirements for the (ZAPM® exam at pmi.org.

Are You Ready for the PMP Exam?
In RMC’s experience, half of those who fail the exam do so because they have not had project management
training that uses PMI terminology and concepts. This is a serious factor to consider in determining
whether you are ready to take the exam. Understanding PM's approach to managing projects is not as
simple as reading the PMBOK' Guide. Although reading the PMB OK' Guide will help you improve your
knowledge, it will not teach you project management. "Hie PMP” Exam Prep book will explain the project
management process and help you understand it from PMI’s perspective; however, if you ﬁnd that many of
the concepts and terms presented in this book are new to you—or you do not use important tools discussed
in this book (such as a charter, WBS or prioritized backlog, network diagram, and management plans)—
you probably need fundamental project management training before continuing to study.
Another percentage of people who fail the exam do not have real-world experience working on large
projects and do not understand the breadth of possible project types. Instead, they may be managing small
projects; some might not even be working as a project manager. On the exam, it is helpful to answer
questions from the perspective of a project manager who is managing large projects, unless a question
scenario tells you otherwise. Therefore, the more experience you have with large projects, the better
prepared you will be for the exam.
'lhe following are examples of large projects:
I Designing and building a new call center (versus handling small call center projects)
I Designing a new manufacturing process (versus customizing a standard product for a customer)
I Installing integrated software across a company (versus installing software system updates)
I Designing and constructing a new building (versus repainting an existing building)
What is the depth of your knowledge and understanding of project management? Do you routinely
experience two or more of the following problems on projects? Ifso, you may beneﬁt from learning more
about project management prior to taking the exam.
I Cost or schedule overruns
I Unrealistic schedules
I Excessive changes to the scope or schedule
I Communication problems and increased conﬂict
I Running out of time near the end of the project
I Unsatisfactory quality
I Low morale
I Team member uncertainty about what needs to be done
I Excessive rework and overtime
I Too many project meetings
Now think about your project management experience, particularly your experience working on
large projects. Review the following list of topics. Do you understand these topics, and do you
currently apply the tools and techniques included in this list when working on your projects?
I 'lhe step—by—step project management process, including understanding why each step is necessary
I ']]1e roles of the project manager, sponsor, product owner, team, and stakeholders
I ']]1e use of historical information from previous projects, including lessons learned
I What a formal project charter is and knowing what it requires
I What a work breakdown structure (WES) is and how to create it

o n E
Tricks of the Tradei‘ for Studying for This Exam
I What a prioritized risk—adjusted backlog is and how to use it
I How to manually create a network diagram
I What the critical path is, how to ﬁnd it, and what beneﬁts it provides the project manager
I Rough order of magnitude (ROM) versus threevpoint estimating or estimating story points
I Monte Carlo analysis
I Earned value analysis
I Schedule compression (crashing and fast tracking)
I Managing ﬂoat
I How to create a realistic schedule
I Managing the quality of both the project and the resulting product(s) or deliverables
I Developing relationships with stakeholders, and keeping them interested and involved in the project
I “That is included in the process of risk management
I Calculating reserves and understanding their relationship to risk management
I Creating a realistic and approved project management plan that you are willing to be held accountable
to achieving
I Monitoring and controlling the project according to the project management plan
I Managing change requests, and controlling change
I Planning and developing iteratively and incrementally for change-driven projects
I Considering the professional and social responsibilities expected of a project manager when managing
a project
When working on projects, a project manager doesn’t have time for ineffective project management
activities. A project can easily get out of control if the project manager spends too much time solving
problems rather than preventing them, or micromanaging instead of making sure roles and responsibilities
are clear. When preparing for the exam, think about the concepts presented in this book (and those you’ve
learned through your training) in terms of what a project manager of a large project should he doing. This
will help you identify gaps between your own project management experience and PMI’s approach to
managing projects, and will therefore better prepare you to answer questions on the exam.
Applying to Take the Exam
You must submit an application to PMI to take the exam. Applications may be submitted online. After
submitting your application, you’ll receive a notice that will conﬁrm your application has been accepted;
you will then be prompted to pay for your exam appointment. Once payment is received, you’ll receive an
email authorizing you to make an appointmmt to take the exam. Once you receive your authorization, you
must pass the exam within one year. You can take the exam up to three times within that year; ifyou fail all
three times, you must wait one year to reapply for the exam. You may be subject to an audit of your
application before it is approved.
The exam is usually offered on a computer at a designated testing site, but this may vary based on
location. Alternatives to traditional testing centers, such as an online proctored exam, may also be an
option. It’s important to understand that there are speciﬁc rules and instructions for each type of exam. In
most cases, the conﬁrmation of your scheduled exam will give you speciﬁc details. Visit pmi.org for the
most accurate and up-to-date information about testing options, locations, and exam languages available.

What Is the PMP Exam Like?
Keep in mind three important things about the PMP exam First, the exam is not a test of the information
in the PMB OK” Guide. Second, you cannot rely only on real—world experience 'lhird, training in
professional project management that is aligned with the PMB OK' Guide and the Examination Content
Outline is critical.
The exam includes 180 questions. These can be multiple—choice, multiple responses, matching,
hotspot (e.g., you might be asked to place identifying plots on a chart), or ﬁll—in—the-blanlc. The exam must
be completed in 2.30 minutes, which is just under four hours. PMI does not publish what it considers to be
a passing score. Based on the exam history, however, we estimate that it is somewhere between 65 and 69
percent (about 117 to 124 questions correct out of 130).
The questions are randomly generated from a database. The questions may jump from topic to topic,
and a single question may integrate multiple concepts. You get one point for each correct answer.

The following are important aspects of the exam:
The exam tests knowledge, application, and analysis. This makes the exam more than a test ofmemory.
You must know how to apply the information in this book and be able to analyze situations involving
this information. Do not expect the exam to have all straightforward, deﬁnition—type questions.
']]1e exam deals with practical experience. The majority of the questions are situational For those
who do not have project management experience, these questions can be extremely diﬁcult.
']]1ere may be instances on the exam where the same data is used for multiple questions.
Historically, there have been exam questions requiring you to identify inputs or outputs from the
PMOK' Guide. To answer these questions correctly you need to know not just the input and output
names, you also need to understand the processes involved and why the inputs feed into and the
outputs result from the processes.
Expect 5 to 10 formula-related calculations on the exam.
Expect 10 to 15 earned-value questions on the exam. Not all of these require calculations using
the formulas.
Most acronyms will he spelled out (for example, the exam typically uses the full term "work breakdown
structure” rather than "WES”? , but you should know both the acronym and the full term. Note that
this is especially true of acronyms you’ll see for formulas, such as CPI, SPI, CV31I 5V, etc.
The correct answers should not include direct quotations from the Pl'iriBCJK‘I Guide.
Most people feel uncertain about only 40 or fewer of the 180 questions on the exam.
The questions on the exam are mostly situational, many are ambiguous and wordy, and some even
seem like they have two or more right answers. Be prepared for the following types of questions so you will
not waste time or be caught 05 guard when you are taking the exam.
1.
Situational questions These questions demonstrate why having project management experience is
critical to passing this exam. Such questions require you to integrate your real—world experience and
your knowledge of the exam concepts. For example:

## Questions with two or more right answers Questions that appear to have two, three, or even four


right answers are a major complaint from many test takers. Many questions will list several choices
that could reasonably be done, or that less-experienced project managers would be likely to choose.
As you go through questions and review the answers in this book, look for questions you think
have more than one right answer and try to ﬁgure out why you think multiple choices are correct. We
have intentionally included such questions in our products to give you exposure to the types of
questions you will see on the exam; we provide explanations to help you understand why your right
answer may not be the best choice.
Let’s look again at the previous situational question. Couldn’t we really do all of the choices? The
right answer is D, but isn’t it also correct to tell the customer? Yes, but that is not the ﬁrst thing to do.
This question is really saying, “What is the best thing to do next?" As you answer practice questions,
keep in mind the concept of the "best thing to do next” to help you decide which answer identiﬁes the
next step in proper project management.
. Questions with extraneous information It is important to realize that not all information included
in a question will be relevant. For examPle, the numbers in the following question are extraneous data.
Question Experience shows that each time you double the production of doors, unit
costs decrease by 10 percent. Based on this, the company determines that
production of 3,000 doors should cost $21,000. This case illustrates:
A. Learning cycle
B. Law of diminishing returns
C. 80/20 rule
D. Parametric cost estimating
Answer
D
. Questions using made-up terms Many people taking the exam expect that all the terms used as
choices should mean something. But that’s not the case. 'lhe exam often includes made-up terms. If
you consider yourselfd trained and see a term on the exam that you do not know, chances are it is
not the right answer. For example:
Question The ongoing deﬁnition of a project as more information becomes available to
the team is called:
A. Scope validation
B. Strategic planning
C. Progressive elaboration
D. Quantitative elaboration
Answer
C
In this question, “quantitative elaboration” (choice D) is not a real project management term.

## Questions where understanding is important Let’s look at the following question:


Question The process of decomposing deliverables into smaller, more manageable
Answer
components is complete when:
A. Project justiﬁcation has been established.
B. Change requests have occurred.
C. Cost estimates can be developed for each work element.
D. Each work element is found in the WBS dictionary.
C
In order to answer this question, you must understand the terms used, including the concept of
decomposition and what value this technique has in the project management process.

## Questions with a new approach to a known topic There will be many instances where you under-


stand the topic but have never thought about it as described . For example:
Question In a matrix organization, information dissemination is most likely to be
Answer
effective when:
A. Information flows both horizontally and vertically.
B. The communication ﬂows are kept simple.
C. There is an inherent logic in the type of matrix chosen.
D. Project managers and functional managers socialize.
A
Many people know what a matrix organization is but have not taken the time to consider how this
organizational structure affects the directions in which information is shared.

## Questions with more than one item in each choice Let’s look at the following example:


Question The seller on the project has presented the project manager with a formal
Answer
notiﬁcation that the seller has been damaged by the buyer’s activities. The
seller claims that the buyer’s slow response to requested approvals has delayed
the project and has caused the seller unexpected expense. The ﬁrst things the
project manager should do are:
A. Collect all relevant data, send the data to the company attorney, and
consult with the attorney about legal actions.
B. Review the contract for speciﬁc agreed-upon terms that relate to the issue,
see if there is a clear response, and consult an attorney if needed.
C. Review the procurement statement of work for requirements, send a
receipt of claim response, and meet to resolve the issue without resorting
to legal action if possible.
D. Hold a meeting with the team to review why the acceptances have been
late, make a list of the speciﬁc reasons, and correct those reasons.
B
These questions can seem hard until you apply this little trick: use the process of elimination, one
item at a time. Consider the ﬁrst item listed in each choice and eliminate the choices that contain an
implausible ﬁrst item. Then look at the second item in each remaining choice and eliminate any
implausible choices. Keep going until you have only one choice remaining.

o u E
Tricks of the Trade® for Studying for This Exam
Watch out; sometimes the items in each choice show a ﬂow or process. See the following example:
Question When managing a project, which of the following is the best order to deal
with problems that arise?
A. Go to the team, go to management, go to resource managers
B. Go to resource managers, go to management, go to the customer
C. Handle it yourself, go to the customer, go to management
D. Resolve problems with resources you control, go to resource managers,
go to the customer
Answer
D
In this case, you need to look at each choice independently to see if the process listed is correct.

## Excessively wordy questions Instead of saying, "The project is behind schedule," the exam might


use wordier phrasing, such as, "The project ﬂoat was zero and has recently gone to negative 2..” Instead
of saying, "The team is not reporting properljg" the exam could say, "The team has lost sight of the
communications management plan.” The ﬁrst step in answering many questions is to determine what
the question is asking, and then to translate the wordy phrasing.
How to Study for the PMP Exam
Some people believe you need to read every resource available and spend as much time as possible preparing
for the PMP exam. Do not make that mistake. You should not read everything you can ﬁnd, as some
resources are not well deﬁned. We recommend the approach outlined in the following sections.
The Magic Three
Studies have shown that if you visit a topic three times, you are more likely to
remember it. Therefore, you should read this book once and then skim through it two more times, focusing
most on the activities you do not do in the real world and on the concepts you have trouble understanding
or remembering.
You should pass through each chapter in this book more than once. When you go through a chapter
for the second time, focus on ﬁlling the gaps you discovered during your ﬁrst time reading it rather than
recreating the complete list for each exercise
Be in Test-Taking Mode
Get used to jumping from one topic to another. You'll also need to practice
answering questions for four hours. You can do this by skipping all practice exams until you feel ready to
answer the questions. Then take all practice exams in one sitting (see step 4 in plan B on page 15). Do not
underestimate the physical, mental, and emotional aspects of taking an exam lasting that long. You can also
get into test-taking mode using our PM FASTrack’ exam simulator.
Your Step-by-Step Study Plan
We recommend that you use one of the following study plans.
Follow Plan A if you own RMC's complete PMP Exam Prep System. Follow Plan B if you do not own the
entire system.

Plan A: Using This Book with the PMP Exam Prep System (PMP‘ Exam Prep book,
PM FASTracW Cloud Exam Simulator, and Hot Topics Flashcards)
One common mistake made by people who purchase the PMP Exam Prep System is to spend most of
their study time answering questions in PM FASTrack'. This approach won’t work As we mentioned
earlier, focus your eﬁorts on reading this book, completing the exercises and review activities, and ﬁlling
the gaps in your experience. Use the following steps to study this book in conjunction with PM FASTrack'
and Hot Topics:
Read this book for the ﬁrst time and complete the exercises, but don’t do the practice exams at the end
of each chapter because you will use FASTrack later. Spend more time on the areas where you have the
most gaps in your knowledge or experience, and on items you did not know or do prior to beginning this
course of study. Refer to Rita’s Process ChartTM (included in chapter 3 of this book) frequently, and be sure
you understand all the eﬁ'orts involved in the knowledge areas you are working on. At the same time, skim
through the corresponding chapterin the PMB OK " Guide to get an understanding of their use of terminology.

## As you ﬁnish each chapter, review the Quicktest on the ﬁrst page of the chapter. Make sure you know


the meaning of each term or concept. Use Hot Topics to improve recall and test your understanding of
that chapter.
2.. possible, form a study group after you have read the book for the ﬁrst time on your own. Your study
time will be more eﬁective. You will be able to ask someone questions, and the studying (and
celebrating afterward) will be more ﬁm. A study group should consist of only three or four people.
(See "How to Use This Book in a Study Group” on page 16.)

## Make sure you really know the material, and then take a full exam simulation on PM FASTrack‘. This


step will give you a baseline against which to track your progress as you continue to study.
WARNING: Limit yourselfto no more than two full exam simulations before you take the actual exam.
Otherwise, you diminish the value of PM FASTrack' by memorizing questions and answers that will
not be presented in the same way on the exam.
WARNING: Ifyou do not score over ‘70 percent the ﬁrst time you take a full exam simulation (not just
an exam on an individual knowledge area or ECO domain), you may need a refresher in core project
management concepts. Ifyou have taken a basic project management class, review the materials you
received from that class. If you have not had such a class, consider taking one.

## Review each question you got wrong in PM FASTrack', writing down the speciﬁc reasons for each


wrong answer. Assess why the correct choice is correct and why the other answers are wrong.

## Use your list of why you got each question wrong (from step 5) to determine what to study further.


This will help you determine how much more study time you need and which chapters to read more
carefully. Continue to study this book, focusing on areas in which you have more gaps and skimming
the sections or chapters on which you did well. Correct errors in your understanding. Review the
PMBOK' Guide to focus on these gaps. And remember, think large project and how proper project
management should be done, regardless of how you manage your projects in the real world.

## Ifyou had diﬂiculty with certain knowledge areas, domains, or concepts, and you have studied your


gap areas, you may want to answer a small sample of questions (no more than 20) using the Knowledge
Area , Domain, or Keyword function in PM FASTrack". Analyze why you answered any questions
wrong, and continue to study gap areas.

o u E
Tricks of the Tradei for Studying for This Exam
WARNING: You might be tempted to answer more than 20 questions, but this should be suﬂicient to
help you assess whether you have progressed in the particular subject matter or whether you need
to study more. Answering more than 20 questions in a particular area can diminish the value of PM
FASTrack' and will not prepare you for the breadth of the exam experience.

## Take your second and ﬁnal PMP simulation exam. You should score over 75 percent before you take


the real exam. You are overusing PM FASTrack' if you see many of the questions repeated.

HOW to USE This BOOK ill a Study Group
To get started, pick someone to lead the discussion of each
chapter (preferably someone who is not comfortable with the chapter, because the presenter often learns
and retains the most in the group). Each time you meet, go over questions about topics you do not
understand and review the hot topics on the exam using the Hot Topics ﬂashcards, if you have them. Most
groups meet for one hour per chapter. Either independently or with your study group do further research
on questions you do not understand or answered incorrectly.
Each member of the study group should have their own copy of this book, which provides exercises,
homework, and even class activities. (Please note that it is a violation of international copyright laws to
make copies of the material in this book or to create derivative works from this copyrighted book.)
Recurring Themes—PMl-isms to Know for the PMP Exam
—
RMC has been helping people pass the PMP exam and become better project managers for more than 20
years. During that time, we have developed the following list of “PMI-isms” that the exam emphasizes but
that many project managers do not know. We suggest you read it now and then remember to reread it
before you take the actual exam. Assuming Phil—isms to be true (unless the question evidence says
otherwise) will help you pick the best answer from what seems like more than one correct answer. Some of
the topics are listed only here, and others are summarized here and described in more detail later in this
book. For the exam, assume that you have (or do) all the following and that these concepts are true for your
projects. As you review these PMI-isms, think about which ones are true for your projects. Ifthere are any
that aren’t true for your projects, you may have a gap in your knowledge. It’s important to make note of any
gaps you may have, and review these gaps as part of your overall study plan.
IMPORTANT: PMI represents project management practices along a range of approaches that
are predictive, change—driven (agile), and hybrid. As you study these PMI-isms, keep in mind
that a project manager may use any approach in order to ﬁt the needs of the project.
1 General PMI-isms
J
Project managers are the center of the project universe. Without a skilled project manager, a project is
destined to fail. 1With a person educated in the skills of project management, regardless of title, a project
will succeed.
The project manager puts the best interests of the project ﬁrst—not their own interests.
The project manager understands the value of the tools and techniques of project management and
knows how to adapt them to a large project. For the exam, it’s helpful to assume, unless otherwise stated,
that the project manager is working on a large project that involves more than 200 people.
Project managers have all the power described in the PMBOK‘ Guide and perform all the stated
activities or have made proactive tailoring decisions.
The project manager is assigned during project initiating, not later in the life of the project.
']11e project manager understands the process of project management (i.e., what to do ﬁrst, second, etc.,
and why).
Organizations have a formal project selection process, and they always choose projects based on how
well those projects meet the organization’s strategic goals.

The project manager always knows why their project was selected by management, and they make sure
those objectives and the business case are met while planning and managing the project.

Team members are motivated, empowered, and engaged, and come prepared with suggestions; they
don’t require micromanagement from the project manager.
The project manager spends time planning, managing, assessing, and monitoring and controlling scope,
schedule, cost, quality, risk, resources, and customer satisfaction.
Organizations have a project management oﬁce (PMO), and that oﬁce has important, clearly deﬁned
responsibilities regarding projects across the organization.
Organizations have project management policies, which the project manager adapts for use on their
project. These policies may include project management methodologies, risk procedures, and quality
procedures.
Aproject may be part of a program or portfolio, and the project’s relationship to other projects could
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence how the project manager works.
Organizations have records (historical information and lessons learned) for previous projects that
include what the work packages were, how much each cost, and what risks were uncovered (part of
organizational process assets). The project manager uses this history to plan the current project. The
project manager feeds historical records and lessons learned from the current project back into the
organization’s knowledge base.
The project manager works within the existing systems and culture of a company (enterprise
environmental factors), and one of a project's results is to provide input to improve those systems.
Every project has a project charter, which authorizes the project and the role of the project manager.
A work breakdown structure (W'BS) and WES dictionary are used on every project. Iftaking an agile
approach, a project manager may also use a backlog and story cards.
A project management plan is not a bar chart, but rather a series of management plans. The project
manager knows what is involved in creating a project management plan.
The project manager creates and keeps current other documents (project documents) in addition to the
project management plan to help plan, manage, and monitor and control a project.
Stakeholders are involved throughout the project. Their needs are taken into account while planning the
project and creating the communications management plan and the stakeholder engagement plan
People must be compensated for their work and deserve a fair and positive environment in which they
can contribute their best work.
Agile stakeholders are represented by a product owner as part of the team. Team members can see
customer perspectives through the use ofpersonas and other agile tools.
Gold plating (adding extra functionality) is not in the best interests of the project and should be
prevented.
Most project managers manage projects in a matrix environment in which tools and techniques are
typically straightforward. However, it’s important to know that concepts and tools such as motivation
theories and conﬂict resolution may become more complicated in alternate environments.
The project manager has a professional responsibility to properly use the tools and processes of project
management appropriate to the selected approach.

Planning is important, and all projects must be planned.
The project manager plans the project with input from the team and stakeholders, not on their own.
Part of planning involves deciding which processes in the PMB 010' Guide and Agile Practice Guide
should be used on each project and how to tailor those processes to the project. The development
approach (predictive or agile) should also be determined and documented.
There are plans for how the knowledge areas of scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources,
communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management will be planned, managed, and
monitored and controlled. These are called management plans, and every project has one for every
knowledge area (note that plan length and detail may vary by size and importance to the project, as well
as by approach).
In an agile environment, a project manager may use guidelines from an appropriate holistic and
formalized methodology in use by the performing organization.
The project manager determines metrics to be used to measure quality.
The project manager plans to improve project processes.
The project manager creates a system to reward team members and stakeholders.
All roles and responsibilities are clearly documented and assigned to speciﬁc individuals on the project.
These may include things such as reporting responsibilities, risk management assignments, and meeting
attendance, as well as project work. Agile teams include generalizing specialists who are experts in one
or more ﬁeld but can and will help in other areas where needed.
The project manager and team focus extensively on identifying risks.
Team members and other stakeholders are assigned risk identiﬁcation and risk management duties.
The project manager realizes that managing risks saves the project time and money.
Project cost and schedule cannot be ﬁnalized without completing risk management.
The project manager creates realistic estimates for the overall project schedule and its associated costs.
The project manager assesses whether the project can meet the end date(s) and other project constraints
and objectives. They then meet with management to resolve any differences before the project work
starts. The project manager knows unrealistic schedules are their fault because they have tools and skills
to help solve them.
The project manager plans when and how to measure performance against the performance
measurement baseline, as documented in the project management plan, but also has other
measurements to use to determine how the project is performing while the work is being done.
The project management plan is realistic, and everyone believes it can be achieved.
The project manager holds a kickoE meeting with the team. Note, the exam deﬁnes a kickoff meeting in
a way that may be diﬁemnt from your understanding of a kickoE meeting.

The project manager is responsible for documenting and sharing knowledge acquired during the project.
The project manager measures against the project management plan to help determine project status
throughout the life of the project.
Projects are reestimated throughout the life of the project to make sure the end date (s) and cost
objectives will be met. 'ﬂaerefore, the project manager almost always knows if the project can meet the
agreed—upon end date (5) and budget.
The project manager has authority and power. They can say no and work to control the project for the
beneﬁt of the customer.
The project manager lets others know they cannot get something for nothing. A change in scope must
be evaluated for its impacts to the project’s schedule, cost, quality, risk, resources, and customer
satisfaction. The project manager has enough data about the project to do this analysis.
The project manager realizes that, over time, not everyone associated with the project will have the same
understanding of what the project is and what could occur during the life of the project. Therefore, the
project manager is continually looking to ensure everyone knows what is going on and has appropriate
expectations.
The project manager understands, and takes seriously, resource responsibilities on a project.
The project manager spends time on such activities as team building and ensuring high team
performance.
The project manager is proactive, and ﬁnds problems early, looks for changes, and prevents problems.
The project manager spends more time focusing on preventing problems than on dealing with problems.
Most problems that occur have a risk response plan already created to deal with them.
Risks are a major topic at every team meeting.
Team meetings do not focus on status. That can be collected by other means.
All changes to a project management plan ﬂow through the change management process and integrated
change control (or its agile equivalent).
The project manager ensures that organizational policies are followed on the project.
The project manager recommends improvements to the performing organization’s standards, policies,
and processes. Such recommendations are expected and welcomed by management.
Quality should be considered whenever there is a change to any component of the project.
Quality should be checked before an activity or work package is considered completed.
The project manager works closely with the quality department in performing some of the quality
activities discussed in the PMB OK' Guide.
The project manager is actively involved with the procurement process and assists in managing
procurements.
The project manager understands contract language.
The project manager makes sure all the terms of a contract are met, including those that do not seem
important.

work a project when it is not.
On the exam, a project is assumed to have the
following characteristics:
It It is a temporary endeavor—with a beginning and
an end.
' It creates a unique product, service, or result.
Does the exam ask, “What is a project?” No, but it
will describe situations, and in your analysis of those
situations, you will need to ask questions such as, “Is
this a project being described?”
So, what is a project? If your manager walked into

you ﬁgure out what is wrong with it and ﬁx it?" Would
this be a project?

Are you reading on before you have thought through the question? If so, read it again, and think about
your answer. This is an important concept, both for the exam and in the real world.
You must ﬁrst take what you are given and organize the work into appropriate projects and for each
project, a life cycle. The project planning process will produce schedules and budgets. Can you schedule
“ﬁx it” if you do not know what is wrong? You can’t; in fact, there may be two or more projects in the
previous scenario. The “Processes and Domains” chapter goes into more detail about dividing work into
projects and life cycle phases.
OF THE
Guide. Think of a project as something new to an organization (has not been done before).
TRADE
When taking the exam, you must identify the development approach. You should have a large
project in mind if an exam question uses a predictive approach. You should also know that the exam will
test your knowledge of agile projects, which may be smaller and embrace adapting to change.

TRICKS
In preparing for the exam, be sure your deﬁnition of a project is in alignment with the PMBOKE
Stakeholders‘
Stakeholders are any people or organizations whose interests may be positively or
negatively impacted by the project or the product of the project. They include the project manager and
team, customer and sponsor, but can also include individuals and groups you may not have thought about
before, such as the project management (Vice, portfolio managers, program managers, functional or
operational managers, business analysts, or other departments or groups within the organization
(marketing, legal, or customer service, for example). Stakeholders may be actively involved in the project
work or may ﬁll an advisory role. Stakeholders may also be external to the organization, including
government regulators, consultants, sellers, end users, customers, taxpayers, banks, and other
ﬁnancial institutions.
Although the "Stakeholders” chapter includes an in-depth discussion of stakeholder management,
stakeholders are discussed throughout this book because a project manager should analyze and manage the
needs and levels of inﬂuence of stakeholders throughout a project and in balance with project constraints.
Project Management
Project management is both a science and an art. The science is the systematic
process of managing project work eﬁiciently and effectively to deliver planned results. This includes
tailoring eﬂbrts to meet the needs of the project and using the appropriate processes and tools to accom—
plish the work. The art of project management relates to how a project manager uses skills such as inﬂu-
encing, organizing, strategizing, and other interpersonal and team skills.
This systematic process of managing project work takes many forms that exist along a continuum,
from predictive approaches to agile and hybrid approaches, as described below:
' Predictive A predictive approach to project management relies on a planning process during which
requirements and scope maybe deﬁned in detail early in the project. Detailed plans are created for the
other project constraints as well (for example, cost, schedule, and risk). Then, the team strives to
adhere to the approved plan as closely as possible and protect the project from changes. This approach
may also be called plan—driven, traditional, or waterfall.
' Agile An agile approach to project management works best for projects where the deﬁnition of proj-
ect scope is emerging. Since it cannot be deﬁned up front, planning, executing, and managing the
project happens in much smaller increments so that changes can be easily made as information about
the product and project’s needs changes. This approach is also known as change-driven or adaptive.
' Hybrid A hybrid approach to project management uses aspects of both predictive and agile
approaches and the approach varies with the needs of the project and the organizational
environment.
There is a big diﬂbrence between managing small and large projects, and between those with predic-
tive approaches and those that use agile or hybrid methods. On a small project, you may walk over to
someone you need to speak to about an issue. On a large project you may have spent weeks planning
communications. You have to ﬁgure out who should be involved in solving an issue, their locations, contact

Framework
information and communication preferences. You will need to answer exam questions based on the infor-
mation given in the question. A large project requires you to use the full breadth of project management
processes and tools, and also requires you to consider using an agile or hybrid approach to project manage-
ment to ﬁt the needs of the project, when necessary.
Effective project management ensures that the organization is focused on the most important work
and that the right work is done correctly and in the most time- and cost-effective manner. Risks are
identiﬁed and planned for before they occur, communication is managed effectively, and speciﬁc quality
metrics are achieved. These eﬁorts result in satisﬁed stakeholders and achievement of business objectives.
Program Management
Grouping related projects into a program allows an organization to coordinate
their management of those projects, as shown in ﬁgure 2.1. This approach focuses on the interdependencies
between projects, works to ensure beneﬁts for which the projects were initiated, may help decrease risk,
and improves overall management. In addition to the work required to complete each individual project,
the program also includes a program manager’s coordination and management activities. So, when you
discover that your work involves more than one project, you can manage the projects as a program if the
program approach adds value. Or, you may collaborate with a program manager if your project is part of an
existing program.

FIGURE 2.1 Program management
Portfolio Management
A portfolio includes programs, projects, and related operational work that are
prioritized and implemented to achieve a speciﬁc strategic business goal (see ﬁgure 2.2). Programs and
projects that make up a portfolio may not be related, other than by their relationship to this common
strategic goal. Combining programs, projects, and operations into one or more portfolios helps optimize
the use of resources, enhances the beneﬁts to the organization, and reduces risk. The work of an organization
can comprise one or multiple portfolios. A project is included in a portfolio based on potential return on
investment, strategic beneﬁts, alignment with corporate strategy, and other factors critical to
organizational success.

Organizational Project Management (0PM) serves
as a guide or driver for project, program, and portfolio management as well as other organizational practices.
It is a framework for keeping the organization focused on overall strategy. 0PM provides direction for how
portfolios, programs, projects, and other organizational work should be prioritized, managed, executed,
and measured to best achieve strategic goals and desired beneﬁts. Figure 2.3 shows how 0PM drives an
organization with project, program, and portfolio management in place to achieve strategic goals.
Understanding how these pieces interrelate, as depicted in this illustration, can help you correctly answer
questions on the exam. Unless a question tells you otherwise, assume this organizational framework is in
place when answering exam questions.

Organizational project management
A key point to understand is that all efforts in the organization—whether they are part of project,
program, portfolio, or operational work—should be guided by the organization and support its strategic
goals. This means that any changes to the organizational strategywill necessitate changes to the organization’s
portfolios, programs, projects, and operational work—both ongoing efforts and future initiatives. For
example, if a project no longer aligns with the organizational strategy, the project maybe changed midcourse
to bring it into alignment, or it may be terminated.
Project Management Office (PMO)3
The PMO is a department within an organization that provides
or ensures compliance with project governance. The PMO oversees and standardizes the management of
projects. It can take one of several forms, including the following:
' Supportive A supportive PMO provides the policies, methodologies, templates, and lessons learned
for managing projects within the organization. It typically exercises a low level of control over projects.

Framework
I Controlling A controlling PMO provides support and guidance on how to manage projects, trains
others in project management and project management software, assists with speciﬁc project man-
agement tools, and ensures compliance with organizational policies. It typically has a moderate level
of control over projects.
I Directive A directive PMO provides project managers for diﬁerent projects, and is responsible for
the results of those projects 3 all projects, or projects of a certain size, type, or inﬂuence, are managed
by this o ”ice. A directive PMO has a high level of control over projects.
The PMO may:
I Manage the interdependencies among projects, programs, and portfolios
I Analyze information from projects to assess whether the organization is achieving its strategic
objectives
I Help provide resources
I Recommend the termination of projects when appropriate
I Monitor compliance with organizational processes
I Help gather lessons learned into a repository and make them available to other projects
I Provide templates for documents such as work breakdown structures, user stories, or communications
management plans
I Provide guidance and project governance
I Provide centralized communication about projects
I Be more heavily involved during project initiating than later in the project
I Have representation on the change control board
I Be a stakeholder
I Prioritize projects

Description

## Read this book for the ﬁrst time and complete all exercises, but don't do the practice exams at the end


of each chapter. Spend more time on the areas where you have the most gaps in your knowledge or
your real-life project management experience, and on items you did not know or did not do prior to
beginning this course of study. Refer to Rita's Process Chartm (included in chapter 3 of this book)
frequently, and be sure you understand all the eﬁ'orts involved in the knowledge areas you are working
on. At the same time, skim through the corresponding chapter in the PMOK' Guide to get an
understanding of the ﬂow of the processes.

## As you ﬁnish each chapter, review the Quicktest terms listed on the ﬁrst page of the chapter to make


sure you know the meaning of each term or concept.

## Ifit is at all possible, form a study group after you have read the book for the ﬁrst time on your own.


This will actually make your study time more eEective. You willbe able to ask someone questions, and
the studying (and celebrating afterward) will be more fun. A study group should consist of only three
or four people. (See the “How to Use This Book in a Study Group” section on page 16.)

## Once you feel conﬁdent about the material, take the practice exams at the end of each chapter in one


sitting. This will give you a baseline to tell you how much you have learned. It will also help you
determine how much additional study time you need and which chapters to read more carefully.

## Review each question you got wrong in the chapter practice exams, writing down the speciﬁc reasons


for each wrong answer on the Score Sheet discussed on page 6. Assess why the correct choice is
correct and why the other answers are wrong. Continue to study this book, focusing on the areas in
which you have gaps in your knowledge and skimming the sections or chapters on which you did welL
Correct any errors in your understanding of the concepts discussed in this be ok. Review the PMB OK'
Guide to focus on these gaps.
WARNING: Ifyou do not score 70 percent or higher overall on the chapter practice exams, you may
need a refresher in core project management concepts. Ifyou have taken a basic project management
class, review the materials you received from that class. If you have not had such a class, consider
taking one. You cannot rely on these practice questions alone to prepare you for the exam.

## Make sure you really know the material, and then retake the practice exams in the book. As with step


5, use the Score Sheet to identify in writing the speciﬁc, not general, reason you got each
question wrong.

## Use your list of why you got each question wrong (from step 6) to determine which material to study


further, and then study this material. Remember, think large project and how proper project
management should be done, regardless of how you manage your projects in the real world. Make
sure you are conﬁdent you have ﬁlled your gaps before taking the exam.

## Provides support and guidance; requires all projects within the organization to use


designated project management software and templates, but do esn’t otherwise exert control
over the project

## Recommends common terminology, templates, reporting, and procedures to be used on


projects throughout the organization to promote consistency and streamline efforts

Project Management’s Organizational Context
Successful projects provide business value and deliver beneﬁts deﬁned in a business case“4 and a beneﬁts
management plan.5 Projects are designed to bring a positive change to an organization, usually to add or
improve pro ducts or services, and in some cases to satisfy legal or other regulatory requirements. They are
selected, initiated, and exist within an organizational context that inﬂuences their desired outputs and what
is needed (inputs) to achieve these outcomes (outputs). Organizational context includes an understanding
of an organization’s operations and projects, governance, and its organizational structure. This context also
includes what the PMBOK‘E’ Guide calls inﬂuences: enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) and
organizational process assets (OPAs).
Since EEFs and OPAs contribute to and are inﬂuenced by the organizational context in which projects
exist, they are essential to understanding domain III (Business Environment) in the Examination Content
Outline (ECO). For a complete view of the project environment, you should also understand that these
factors inﬂuence and are inﬂuenced by a set of frequently used tools and techniques available within the
organization and developed through individual experience.
Operations and Projects
Most work done in organizations can be described as either operational or
project work. Operational work is ongoing work to support the business and systems of the organization,
whereas project work ends when the project is closed. Understand the difference for the exam. You may see
instances where the real problem in the question is that someone is attempting to manage ongoing
(operational) work, such as manufacturing, as a project.
Although these are two distinct areas of work, they are closely connected. When a project is ﬁnished,
the deliverables are transitioned to ongoing business operations so the beneﬁts of the project work can be
incorporated into the organization. A successful transition may require employee training or adjustments
to operational processes. For example, when an insurance company’s internal project to develop a new
caseload tracking system is completed, employees will need to learn how to use the system and adjust their
processes to incorporate it into their daily work so the beneﬁts can be realized.
And this relationship goes both ways. While a project may develop a product or service to be used in
operational work, the need to change or improve operational work may prompt the initiation of a project.
For example, the need to develop a new caseload tracking system may have arisen from problems occurring
in the organization’s business operations. As another example, imagine the caseload tracking system has
moved into operations and users have started working with it, but some bugs have been identiﬁed. Fixing

T w 0
Framework
these bugs would likely be addressed as the operational work of maintaining business systems rather than
as a new project. If the organization decides new features or functions must be added to the caseload
tracking system after it is in operation, however, this may prompt a new project.
It is important to note that the approach to new projects within an organization is not dependent on
a chosen approach used in the past. For instance, the initial caseload tracking system may have been a large
project with well-deﬁned requirements that took months or years to complete and had been managed using
a predictive approach. Adding new features would be a much smaller project and an adaptive approach
could be the best choice for this new project, depending on several factors, including project uncertainty,
magnitude, and predictability of outcomes.
Governance
Every organization is different, and governance is designed to support the speciﬁc culture
and attributes of the organization. Organizational governance affects and is affected by project governance,
the organization’s culture and structure, and the business environment.
Organizational Governance Organizational governance refers to the overall structure of an organization.
It involves setting the policies and procedures for how work will be performed to meet strategic goals and
to support organizational operations and decision—making. There may be multiple levels of governance
within an organization, although this can vary. Generally, a board of directors is responsible to ensure that
work throughout the organization conforms to external (government or regulatory) and internal standards
and requirements. Internal requirements include policies and procedures regarding portfolio, program,
project, and operations work, which help to ensure that these endeavors are within the strategic plan of the
organization and that they contribute to the delivery of speciﬁc beneﬁts or value.
Project Governance The ECO task 14 in the Process domain (establish project governance structure)
requires project managers to determine their project governance so that the project is in agreement with
organizational governance. Do you establish project governance structure on your projects? How does
governance differ between predictive and adaptive projects? Predictive governance typically involves
formal documentation and upfront analysis and agreement. Agile governance, in contrast, is generally less
structured but still aligns with the necessary policies and procedures of the organization. It’s important to
keep in mind both predictive and adaptive approaches as you may see exam questions that will test your
knowledge of both project environments.
Project governance can be established and administered by a PMO. It may involve deﬁning a project
managers authority and the creation or enforcement of processes and policies regarding areas such as risk,
resources, communications, and change management.
Governance may also involve planning and managing project compliance in regulations, security, and
safety. The awareness of these requirements helps shape the best approach for a project. For instance,
potential regulatory restrictions on a new energy project might lead you down the path of an agile hybrid
approach, but there are multiple agile methodologies you could choose.
organizational Structure
One of the primary forms of inﬂuence on projects is how the company is
organized. The organizational structure will dictate who the project manager goes to for help with resources,
how communications must be handled, and many other aspects of project management. This inﬂuence is
so important that an answer to a question on the exam can change depending on the structure of the
organization being discussed.
Questions on the exam are often phrased in terms of the project managers level of authority and how
the form of organization impacts their management of projects. For example, exam questions may deal
with who has the power in each type of organization (the project manager or the functional manager), or
they may require you to understand the advantages and disadvantages to the project manager in each type
of organization.
27

Framework
T w 0
28
As you read through the following sections deﬁning the different organizational structures, take time
to think about how each form would impact your work as a project manager and how you would solve
problems in diﬁerent situations within each structure.
Functional This is a common organizational structure. Functional organizations are grouped by areas of
specialization within functional areas, such as accounting, marketing, or manufacturing. Projects generally
occur within a single department, so when you see "functional” on the exam, think "silo.” Ifinformation or
project work is needed from another department, employees transmit the request to the head of the depart-
ment who communicates the request to the other department head. Otherwise, communication stays
within the project. Team members complete project work in addition to normal departmental work.
Project-oriented In a project-oriented, or projectized organization, the entire company is organized by
projects. The project manager has control of the project and personnel are assigned and report to them.
When you see nproject-oriented” on the exam, think “no home.” Team members complete only project
work, and when the project is over, they do not have a department to go back to. They need to be assigned
to another project or get a job with a different employer. Communication primarily occurs within
the project.
Matrixﬁ This form is an attempt to maximize the strengths of both the functional and project-oriented
structures. When you see "matrix” on the exam, think “two managers.” Team members report to two
managers: the project manager and the functional manager (for example, the engineering manager).
Communication goes from team members to both managers. Team members do project work in addition
to normal departmental work.
In a strong matrix, power rests with the project manager. In a weak matrix, power rests with the
functional manager, and the power of the project manager is comparable to that of a coordinator (who has
some authority and can make some decisions but reports to a higher-level manager) or expediter (who
coordinates communications and assists but cannot make or enforce decisions). In a balanced matrix, the
power is shared between the functional manager and the project manager.

A tight matrix has nothing to do with a matrix organization. It simply refers to colocation—the

practice of locating workspaces for the project team in the same room. Because it sounds
TRADE-
similar to other forms, it has often been used as a fourth choice for these questions on the exam.
2.2 Exercise Test yourself! Questions on the exam will test your understanding of the advantages
and disadvantages of the different organizational structures (functional, project—oriented, and
matrix). In your Exercise Notebook, list the advantages and disadvantages of each organizational
structure. Understanding the differences between these structures will help you evaluate situations

Inputs and OLIIIJLIIS
Inputs are what you need in order to complete a process and outputs or outcomes
are what you have when it is completed. Inputs and outputs are logical and should not require memorization
if you have a good understanding of the actions involved in each of the knowledge area processes. Test your
understanding by answering the following question: What is an input to stakeholder register?
An answer to the question might include a potential stakeholder list and contact information!1 historical
information;1 and a stakeholder register template with instructions:1 but there are other inputs you could
have thought about. The output or outcome is the completed stakeholder register.

Do not expect all the inputs tested on the exam to be included or clearly stated in the PMB OKE' Guide.
For example, you know you need the project team (or at least an initial version of the team) to create a WES,
yet the team is not speciﬁcally listed as an input to creating a WB S. The remaining chapters in this book will
help you understand the processes of project management along with their inputs and outputs.
Let’s take inputs to project initiating as another example of working with inputs and outputs. Try
this exercise.

In preparing for the exam and as you study the rest of this book, keep in mind that all the
frequently used inﬂuencing factors or tools and techniques within each chapter may not be
listed. Instead, the tools and techniques that have been included within a chapter are unique to
that knowledge area. For example, when we talk about deﬁning scope in the "S cop e” chapter, we highlight
product analysis as a tool and technique to be used in this process, but we do not talk about expert
judgment, data analysis, decision making, or interpersonal and team skills because these are tools and

Frequently USBd TOOIS and TBChlUBS
There are over 100 tools and techniques in the PMBOK‘”
Guide, and there are many more that we discuss in this book. The key is to use the right ones for the right
purpose under the right conditions. It is also important to realize tools and techniques can have multiple
applications throughout the project management process.
You don’t have to be an expert at using all of them; but you do need to understand the purpose of each
tool and technique. The following are categorized by their function.
Data Gathering
If you need to collect input from stakeholders, you can use one or more of the following
data-gathering tools and techniques:
" Benchmarking
' Interviews
' Brainstorming
' Market research
' Prompt lists
' Questionnaires and surveys
'
Checklists
Data Analysis
Depending on the type of data you are working with and the depth of analysis you need
to do, you can choose from many data analysis tools and techniques, including the following:
' Alternatives analysis
' Root cause analysis
' Assumptions and constraints
' Simulation
' Cost-beneﬁt analysis
' SWOT
' Document analysis
' Trend analysis
' Earned value analysis
' Value stream mapping
' Performance reviews
' Variance analysis
' Reserve analysis
' What-if analysis
Data Representation
Throughout the project, you will gather and generate data from various sources
for a number of purposes and transform that data to information through data analysis. This category
includes options for representing, or communicating, data and information. Data representation tools and
techniques include the following:
' Afﬁnity diagrams
' Mind mapping
' Cause-and-effect diagrams
' Probability and impact matrices
' Control charts
' Release maps
I Flowcharts
' Scatter diagrams
' Hierarchical charts
" Stakeholder engagement assessment matrices
' Histograms
' Stakeholder mapping/ representation
' Logical data models
' Text-oriented formats
' Matrix diagrams 2’ charts
Decision-Making
Throughout the project, you will have to make countless decisions, often with the
input of the project team. The use of data analysis and representation all support decision making. There are
many approaches to decision-making, including the following techniques, which are used in many project
management processes:
' Fist of ﬁve
' Multicriteria decision analysis
' Voting

Communication
As you will read later in this book, a great deal of a project manager’s time is spent
communicating with management, the team, the customer, and other stakeholders. The following are
several important communication techniques and concepts you will use throughout the project:
' Active listening
' Meeting management
' Appreciative inquiry
' Communication methods
' Feedback
' Communications technology
'
Presentations
Interpersonal and Team Skills
Interpersonal and team skills are elements of the art of project manage-
ment. Closely related to the communication techniques and concepts listed above, the following skills are
essential for project success:
' Conﬂict management
' Meeting management
' Cultural awareness
' Motivation
' Decision-making
' Negotiation
' Emotional intelligence
' Networking
' Facilitation
' Observation/ conversation
' Inﬂuencing
' Political awareness

Estimating
The project manager is responsible for leading estimating eﬁorts for many aspects of the
project, including schedule, cost, and resources. The following are common estimating techniques you will
learn about in this book:
' Analogous
' Top—down
It Bottom—up
' Expert judgment
' Parametric

Project Management Information System (PMIS)
An organization’s project management information
system is part of its enterprise environmental factors. The PMIS includes automated tools, such as sched-
uling software, a conﬁguration management system, shared workspaces for ﬁle storage or distribution,
work authorization software, time-tracking software, and procurement management software, as well as
repositories for historical information. The PMIS is used in many planning, executing, and monitoring and
controlling processes.
Expert Judgment
Sometimes, the easiest way to get information is to consult experts. Often, those with
expertise needed by the project are working on the team, or at least within the organization. Expert judg—
ment is a common tool of the project management planning processes, although it is not frequently
discussed in this book.
Meetings
Meetings are often used in the planning processes of a project, although you will not always
see meetings discussed in this book as a planning tool. Meetings can be an effective way to get input or
feedback from groups of people, but they can be overused. The project manager is responsible for deter-
mining whether a meeting is worth the time of those who would attend it, or if there is a more e ”l cient way
to achieve an objective. The value of meetings, as well as some suggested ground rules for meetings, is
discussed in the nT‘tesources‘l’ chapter.
Work Performance Data, Information, and Reports a great deal of data and information is
generated, considered, and communicated throughout the life of a project, from initial observations and
measurements to analyzed content and reports. The PMB OK“r Guide uses three different terms to identify
the stages through which this data and information move. Work performance data includes the initial
measurements and details about activities gathered during the Direct and Manage Project Work process in

T w 0
Framework
executing. When monitoring and controlling a project, work performance data is analyzed to make sure it
conforms to the project management plan. It is also assessed to determine what the data means for the
project as a whole. The result is known as work performance information. Work performance information
can then be organized into work performance reports, which are distributed to the various stakeholders
who need to receive and possibly act on the information.
For example, let’s say a project team performs their assigned work according to the project management
plan. A certain activity took 10 hours and was completed on July 21. This is work performance data. The
next step is to look at how this data compares to the project management plan (in this case, the project
schedule). The activity was estimated to take 12 hours, with an estimated completion date of July 22.. You
can analyze why this activity took less time than planned and what this will mean for the rest of the project.
Why was the work completed early? Wil' this mean improved performance for the rest of the project? Did
the team follow the communications management plan and notify resources assigned to successor activities
about the anticipated early completion so they could start their work early? Should future activities be
reestimated if similar resources will be performing similar work? The result of this analysis is work
performance information. This information can then be organized into work performance reports that are
distributed through the Manage Communications process. If the activity was on the critical path and had
taken longer than scheduled, a formal change request might have been required to adjust the rest of
the schedule.
Project Selection
In addition to understanding the general organizational context in which projects exist, you should
understand what happens before a project is initiated. A project manager should know a project’s history in
order to manage it effectively and achieve the results for which it was intended.
The departments and individuals within your company present management with requests for many
different initiatives (potential projects), all of which would require an investment of corporate resources.
When answering questions on the exam, assume that the organization has a formal process to review and
analyze these potential projects and select the project that best aligns with the strategic goals of the
organization. There might even be a project selection committee in place to evaluate project proposals.
A project manager is not typically involved in project selection. So, you might ask, "Why is this an
important topic to understand?” Good question! The reasons a project is selected and the value it is
expected to bring to an organization indicate its signiﬁcance to the company. The project manager needs to
know if the project was selected because it will establish a new area of business, if it is being implemented
to meet regulatory or compliance requirements, or if it was chosen because it was the least expensive or
most feasible solution to a problem. The reasons a project was selected can impact which constraints are
most ﬂexible and will inﬂuence how the project manager plans and manages the project. A project manager
must keep the reasons the project was selected in mind throughout the project to ensure the objectives are
achieved.
For the exam, you should be familiar with the project selection methods described next, but
understanding these methods is not as important as knowing that such activities occur prior to initiating a
project. These activities fall outside the project boundaries (the period from project authorization through
closure).
Economic Measures for Project SBIBCla
The following sections discuss several economic
measures11 that can be used for analyzing potential projects for selection. Some of these measures are also
used in processes such as quality, cost, and risk management, and in integrated change control. The
measures can be used to develop project metrics, determine when changes to the plan are needed, and
evaluate progress, changes, and overall project success. Such economic measures take a comparative
approach.
35

Framework
T w o
36
Keep in mind that these measures aren’t generally used on their own, that is, an organization would
likely consider more than one of these measures (along with other factors) when selecting a project.
Return on Investment (ROI) Return on investment determines the potential proﬁtability of an invest-
ment by calculating the beneﬁts received in relation to the cost.
Present Value (PV) Note that you may encounter a couple of questions on the exam that require you to
calculate present value. Present value means the value today of future cash ﬂows, and it can be calculated
using the following formula:
FV
FV = future value
PV = W
r = interest rate
11 = number of time periods
The acronym PV is also used for planned value (described in the “Cost” chapter). You can avoid
confusing these terms by considering the context in which they are used. If the question involves project
work that has started and you are evaluating schedule or cost performance, the acronym PV represents
planned value within earned value management. If the question is discussing how the project was evaluated
for selection or funding, PV represents present value.
Using a simple example, see if you can answer the following question:
Question
Is the present value of $300,000 to be received three years from now, with an expected
interest rate of 10 percent, more or less than $300,000?
Answer
Less. You can put an amount of money less than $300,000 in the bank and in three
years have $300,000.
To perform the calculation: $300,000 /’ (1 + 0.1)3 = $300,000/ 1.331 = $225,394.
Net Present Value (NPV) You will not have to calculate NPV, just know that it is the present value of the
total beneﬁts (income or revenue) minus the costs over many time periods. Generally, if the NPV is posi-
tive, the investment is a good choice—unless an even better investment opportunity exists. The project
with the greatest NPV is typically selected.
Do you already have a good understanding of this topic? Test yourself with the following question.
Question
An organization has two projects from which to choose. Project A will take three
years to complete and has an NPV of $45 ,000. Project B will take six years to complete
and has an NPV of $85,000. Which one is a better investment?
Answer
Project B. The number of years is not relevant, as that would have been taken into
account in the calculation of the NPV.
Internal Rate of Return (IRR) To understand this concept, think of a bank account. You put money in a
bank account and expect to get a return—for example, 1 percent. You can think of a project in the same way.
If a company has more than one project in which it could invest, the company may look at the returns of the
different projects and then select the project with the highest return.
IRR does get confusing when you give it a formal deﬁnition: the rate (“interest rate”) at which the
project inﬂows (“revenues”) and project outﬂows (”costs”) are equal. Calculating IRR is complex and
requires the aid of a computer. You will not have to perform any IRR calculations on the exam. Simply
know that the higher the IRR number, the better.
Question
An organization has two projects from which to choose: Project A with an IR of 21
percent and Project B with an IR of 15 percent. Which one is a better option?
Answer
Project A

Framework
Payback Period This term refers to the length of time it takes for the organization to recover its investment
in a project before it starts accumulating proﬁt. For example:
Question
There are two projects from which to cheese: Project A with a payback period of six
months and Project B with a payback period of 13 months. Which one should the
organization select?
Answer
Project A
Based on the information given in this example, the project with the shorter payback period is the best
choice, but that payback period is likely to be one of several ﬁnancial factors, along with other considerations,
used in selecting a project. In some cases, the best choice might be a project that has a longer payback
period but various other advantages.
Cost-Beneﬁt Analysis Cost-beneﬁt analysis compares the expected costs of a project to the potential ben-
eﬁts it could bring the organization. (For project selection purposes, beneﬁts are the same as revenue.
Remember that revenue is not the same as proﬁt.) This analysis results in the calculation of a beneﬁt—cost
ratio, which can be expressed as a decimal or a ratio. Abeneﬁt-cost ratio of greater than 1 means the beneﬁts
are greater than the costs. A beneﬁt-cost ratio of less than 1 means the costs are greater than the beneﬁts. A
beneﬁt-cost ratio of 1 means the costs and beneﬁts are equal.
Question
What does a beneﬁt—cost ratio of 1.7 mean?
A.
The costs are greater than the beneﬁts.
B.
Revenue is 1.7 times the costs.
C.
Proﬁt is 1.7 times the costs.
D.
Costs are 1.7 times the proﬁt.
Answer
B. The beneﬁts, or revenue, the project brings to the organization are 1.7 times the
cost of the initiative. Remember, the beneﬁt—cost ratio calculation is looking at
revenue, not the smaller ﬁgure of proﬁts.
The organization may use the beneﬁt-cost ratio to help choose from many potential projects. A project
manager may also perform cost-beneﬁt analysis to determine the best solution approach once a project is
selected. The project manager may perform the analysis at a high level during project initiating and at a
more detailed level during project planning. This information helps determine things such as what level of
quality efforts are appropriate for the project, what equipment or technology should be purchased, and
whether it would be best to outsource certain pieces of work.

The following are some additional accounting terms related to project selection that you should be
familiar with for the exam.
Economic Value Added (EVA) 12. For project selection, this concept is concerned with whether the proj-
ect returns more value than the initiative costs. (Note that this is a different concept than earned value
analysis, which can also have the acronym of EVA. Earned value (in the n‘Cost‘l’ chapter) is frequently men-
tioned on the exam, whereas economic value added should rarely appear in questions or answer choices.
Opportunity Cost This term refers to the opportunity given up by selecting one project over another. This
does not require any calculation. See the following example:
Question
An organization has two projects to choose from: Project A with an NPV of $45,000
and Project B with an NPV of $85,000. What is the opportunity cost of selecting
Project B?
Answer
$45,000. The opportunity cost is the value of the project not selected.
Sunk Costs Sunk costs are exp ended costs. People unfamiliar with accounting standards might have trou-
ble with the following question:
Question
An organization has a project with an initial budget of $1,000,000. It is half complete
and has spent $2,000,000. Should the organization consider that it is already
$1,000,000 over budget in determining whether to continue with the project?
Answer
No. The money spent is gone.
Sunk costs should not be considered when deciding whether to continue with a troubled project.
Law of Diminishing Returns13 This law states that after a certain point, adding more input (for example,
programmers) will not produce a proportional increase in productivity (such as modules of code per
hour). A single programmer may produce at a rate of 1 module per hour. With a second programmer, the
two may produce at a rate of 1.75 modules per hour (0.75 increase). With a third programmer, the group
may produce at a rate of 2.25 modules per hour (0.5 increase). This disparity may be due to many factors.
For example, additional coordination is required as more programmers are added to a project.
Working Capital This term refers to an organization’s current assets minus its current liabilities. In other
words, it is the amount of money the company has available to invest, including investing in projects.
Depreciation Large assets, such as equipment, lose value over time. Accounting standards call this depre-
ciation. Several methods are used to account for depreciation. The exam may ask you what they are. You
will not have to perform any calculations. (See, we said we could make this easy for you!) Rather, you
should simply understand the following concepts about the two forms of depreciation:
' Straight-line depreciation With straight—line depreciation, the same amount of depreciation is
taken each year.
Example: A. $1,000 item with a 10-year useful life and no salvage value (the value of an item at the end
of its life) would be depreciated at $100 per year.
' Accelerated depreciation For many years, the exam has not asked detailed questions on this topic.
Just know the following:

T w 0
Framework
— There are two forms of accelerated depreciation:
x- Double declining balance
"a Sum of the years digits
-- Accelerated depreciation depreciates faster than straight-line depreciation.
Example: A $1,000 item with a 10-year useful life and no salvage value (the value of an item at the end
of its life) would be depreciated at $130 the ﬁrst year, $150 the second, $ 130 the next, and so on.

need to understand that there 1s a selection process for a project, know what that process is, and
be aware that the project must support the company’s strategic goals.
Second, the exam may use a project selection concept, such as internal rate of return, as an answer to
a question or as a distractor. Such information may be provided in the question even when you do not
need it to answer the question. Read the questions carefully to pick out the relevant data.
The project selection process includes the development of a business case. The business case
describes the business need, the proposed solution, and the expected value of the change. It includes both
tangible and intangible costs and beneﬁts of the proposed solution. The business case will inﬂuence how
you approach every project management process covered in this book, beginning with the creation of a
project charter — the ﬁrst of many processes that facilitate the success of a project.
Project Holes
For the exam, it’s important to understand who’s involved in a project and what they should be doing. This
section will help you focus on roles and responsibilities within the context of the exam for the project
manager, the sponsor, team, and other stakeholders as well as functional (resource) managers and pro gram
and portfolio managers. Each role is explained and then there is an exercise for reviewing more speciﬁc
responsibilities for each role.
The RDIE 0f the PI‘DjBCl Manager In a traditional plan-driven environment, the project manager is
accountable for managing the project to meet project objectives and deliver its value and beneﬁts to the
organization. In a change-based environment, the project manager may perform similarly to an agile coach
(also known as a scrum master or team lead) who manages the processes and facilitates work for the team,
while a product owner is accountable for delivering the project’s value and beneﬁts. As you prepare for the
exam, think about your role on projects. Do you have the knowledge, abiiities, and authority described in
this book? Do you fully plan and control your projects? Are you leading and managing effectively?
This role includes gathering information to get the project started, ensuring that the project is
completed according to the schedule and budget, including approved changes and that it meets other
objectives. The project manager directs and contributes to the project’s planning and manages the team’s
work and physical resources while the team works to build the product of the project.
It’s important to know that using interpersonal and team skills, team building, and enabling a safe and
motivating environment may be more useful than using a “command and control” approach (this is
described in more detail in the "Resources” chapter). In this type of project environment, the focus is on
understanding what motivates your team members and then aligning their project tasks with the project
purpose and their goals.
A good way to think about this is to compare the concepts of "management” and "leadership” as
shown in Figure 2.5.

FIGURE 2.5 Management as. Leadership Focus
Can you have leadership without management? No. You need the mechanics of management in place.
But to be truly effective, you need to have a good balance of leadership and the mechanics of management
to successfully manage a project. Team productivity is best ampliﬁed through a combination of management
and leadership.
Too often project managers may not realize they lack knowledge of what proper project management
involves, and traditionally many companies do not understand why project management is so important in
delivering the beneﬁts they want to realize. A project managers level of authority to make decisions can
also vary depending on organizational structure and other factors, such as whether they are assigned part—
time or under contract.
The RDIB DI the Project SDDI'ISDI‘I Initiator
Abasic deﬁnition of a sponsor is one who provides the ﬁnan—
cial resources for the project — typically someone in management. The sponsor also supports the project
and protects it from unnecessary changes. The role of the sponsor may be ﬁlled by two or more individuals,
working together. In procurement situations, the project sponsor also represents the buyer. In such cases,
the selling organization should also have a sponsor.
In agile and hybrid approaches, the product owner’s role is in some ways analogous to that of a sponsor,
being responsible for ensuring the project delivers value and beneﬁts. But notice that in the previous
section the product owner was also described as having a role similar in some ways to that of a project
manager. For the exam, be careful to think about the role being described in the question.
Think about your company’s management as you read this. Do they know what their role is on
projects? How can you help them better understand their role? Without having the sponsor or someone
performing a sponsor’s functions, the project will suffer, wasting time and resources. Someone must serve
as a protector of the project and its priorities so long as the project continues to meet the organization’s
strategic goals.
The HDIB 0f the Pl'ﬂd UBI Manager
There are usually multiple projects over the course of a product’s life
cycle. In an agile environment, the product manager is typically the lead of the product owners and is ulti-
mately accountable for the pro duct value and beneﬁts. But the term pro duct manager is not limited to agile
environments and its exact meaning may depend on organizational culture. While you are not likely to see
a speciﬁc question about this on the exam you may see the term used, so it’s helpful to understand it in the
agile contest.
The RDIB DI the PI‘DjECt Team
The project team is a group of people, including the project manager, who
will complete the work of the project. Team members can change throughout the project as people are
added to and released from the project. An agile environment may include the concept of keeping stable
teams within an organization and bringing projects to the team, while more traditional approaches tend to
assemble teams as new projects are initiated.

T w 0
Framework
Generally, it is the team’s role to help plan what needs to be done by creating the ‘WBS or backlog and
estimates for their work packages or activities. Team members complete activities to produce the
deliverables or outcomes represented as work packages or features and help look for deviations from the
project management plan during project executing and monitoring and controlling. In agile environments,
team members are responsible for clarifying user stories with the customer so that they can estimate and
plan the releases and iterations, hold reviews and retrospectives, and update the project information using
tools like Kanban boards and burndown charts.
On large projects, there may be too much project management work for one person to perform.
Therefore, the project manager may select team members to help perform project management activities.
The PMBOKE Guide refers to these people as the project management team. Members of this team must
have project management training. For the exam the term n‘project management team” refers to this subset
of the team or project team, and it includes the project manager.
The RDIB 0f the Stakeholders A stakeholder is anyone who will be impacted by the project or can posi-
tively or negatively inﬂuence the project. This includes the customer or end user, the project manager and
team, the project’s sponsor, program and portfolio managers, the project management o "i ce, functional or
operational managers within the organization, other departments or groups within the organization (such
as business analysis, marketing, procurement, quality, or legal), and external sellers that provide services or
materials for the project. Questions about the role of stakeholders and how they or their work should be
managed appear throughout the exam.
The stakeholders’ role on a project is determined by the project manager and the stakeholders
themselves. Stakeholders should be involved in planning the project and managing it more extensively than
many people are used to on their projects. For example, project managers should involve the customer in
planning and controlling a project. Customer representation is built into agile environments through the
role of product owner or value management team, and this is increasingly so on hybrid and traditional
projects. The product owner role can be ﬁlled by someone from the business who is responsible for working
with the team to prioritize features.
The ROIB 0f the Functional {Jl‘ RBSDUI‘CB Manager A functional or resource manager is responsible for
the human and physical resources in a speciﬁc department, such as IT, engineering, public relations,
marketing, etc., and for working with the project manager to meet the needs of the project. As managers of
people, facilities, or equipment, functional or resource managers maintain a calendar indicating availability
of these resources for projects and organizational work. This might involve negotiation if people, faci.ities,
or equipment are needed by more than one project at the same time. If there are issues with resources
provided by the functional manager, project managers collaborate with them to resolve them.
Earlier in this chapter we discussed different organizational structures. The degree that functional
managers are involved in a project depends on whether the organization has a matrix, project-oriented, or
functional organizational structure. To avoid conﬂict, the project manager and functional managers must
balance their respective needs regarding the use of resources to complete project and operational work. It
is generally the responsibility of the project manager to manage this relationship by using clear
communication and interpersonal and team skills, such as conﬂict management and emotional intelligence.
The ROIB 0f the Program Manager
The program manager is responsible for managing a group of related
projects, combined into programs to provide coordinated control, support, and guidance. The program
manager provides oversight to meet both project and program goals.
The RDIE Of the Portfolio Manager
The portfolio manager is responsible for governance at an executive
level of the programs, projects, and operational work that make up a portfolio. A project is included in a
portfolio based on its association with other projects, programs, and operations that support the same
organizational strategic goals and other factors critical to organizational success.

Managing Change
We have organized how change is managed into three main categories: project
change, transitional change, and environmental change. While these are not terms you will ﬁnd on the
exam; these categories may help you understand how change is managed on a project.
The ﬁrst category is project change: those changes within a project that affect the success of the
project. The second category is brought about by the solution. We will call this second category transitional
change: those positive changes your project is meant to bring to your organization and its associated
stakeholders (e.g., customers, communities, government, sellers). The third category represents
environmental changes (external to the project) that will potentially affect the ﬁrst two categories of change.
While these categories make for a convenient way to articulate different qualities of change, they are
not mutually exclusive. Different types of change overlap and are often interdependent. Like project
constraints, you cannot evaluate change in one category without thinking about its effects on the others.
Project Change Project change management is discussed in further detail in the "Integration” chapter, but
here we list some examples of how good project management practices help to manage changes within
a project.
' Iterative and rolling wave planning support the understanding within traditional project management
that as a project progresses new information will become available and some information will change
and plans will need to be updated periodically.
' In traditional project management, the progression from rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimating
for project selection and initiation is followed by more deﬁnitive estimating using tools like scope
decomposition, network diagramming, and three—point estimating during planning.
' Phase-gate systems for projects allow the team and stakeholders to pause, evaluate, and approve what
has happened so far on the project and then make a decision to move on to the next phase. Changes
may be made to policies and procedures at these milestones.
' Integrated change control is the process of managing changes within the project, ensuring that
changes to the project are necessary and carried out systematically.
' Agile project management supports a continual state of project change through iterative and
incremental planning and execution. Delivery of successive MVP increments and ﬁne tuning of
development work can be done with tools such as high-level release planning, experimental spikes for
exploring uncertainty, and cycles of time-b oxed iterations.
Transitional Change Why do we do projects in the ﬁrst place? A project is undertaken for the express
purpose of ﬁlling a business need to bring about positive change of a speciﬁc nature. So, before a project
starts its stakeholders are in a situation called a current state. The project is meant to bring the stakeholders
to a future state deﬁned by the project objectives and requirements. Project management is geared toward
building the end result but also toward helping stakeholders make the transition from current to future
state. By their very nature, projects are about managing change.
However positive a new solution is, people need help making the transition to it. Following are some
examples of how that might be managed:
' A simple change to an already existing software product automatically downloads on stakeholder
devices and a pop up summarizes the changes.
' A new software rollout will completely change the way processes are completed in the organization.
The project is part of a coordinated program that includes a communications director managing a
carefully planned communications project while a training director manages an implementation and
training project.
47

Framework
48
T W O
' An already excellent pro duct is being up dated, so included in the new product rollout is a trade-in and
rebate program that gives customers incentives to buy the new product.
Environmental Change Think of this category as twofold. Changes to the external business environment
that may impact your project and organizational change that may impact (or be impacted by) your project.
Let’s say a project has already started and is going well. The project manager has a plan to address changes
and can easily take change requests within the project into consideration. But, for example, what happens
when something changes within the supporting organization? Now what?
Organizational changes may require changes to the project team, rework, schedule changes, and more.
Understanding organizational culture, politics, and governance will enable you to make needed changes in
ways that minimize negative effects and keep the project moving forward. What about the external business
environment? The industry you are working in, technology, regulations, geopolitical factors, and
marketplace sectors can all experience change that will impact your project.
Consider these examples of environmental change:
Your major project is to develop battery technology for electric cars. A competitor releases a battery
to the market with a capacity marginally exceeding the one you are set to achieve with your project.
You will need to lead a project change effort within your organization, which you know is very averse
to change on major projects.
Your organization has merged with another company and you will lead efforts to evaluate the
continued viability of your project within the new organization.
A natural disaster aﬁecting the region from which your project is being managed will affect your
project. Risk management planning has to take this into account.
A regulation governing your product has changed so that your project can begin closing sooner than
expected, having accomplished all work that still aligns with the project charter. You can transition
the product as-is to the marketplace.
How do you consider facilitating change? Regardless of the type of changes taking place on your
project or in your environment, the process is the same!
1.
E d “ ? ? ?
Have a high level of sophistication about your products and services, your organization, and
your environment.
Maintain awareness and monitor the possibility of change of any kind.
As potential changes are identiﬁed, evaluate the changes and their impacts.
Plan your response.
Lead the team in operating within the organization and the project to support your planned response.

Your management team has decided that all orders will be treated as projects and that project managers
will be used to update orders daily, to resolve issues, and to ensure the customer formally accepts the
product within 30 days of completion. Revenue from the individual orders can vary from $100 to
$150,000. The project manager will not be required to perform planning or provide documentation
other than daily status. How would you deﬁne this situation?
Because each individual order is a “temporary endeavor,” each order is a project.
This is pro gram management since there are multiple projects involved.
This is a recurring process.
Orders incurring revenue over $100,000 would be considered projects and would involve

Answers

## Answer D


Explanation The main drawback of a project-oriented organization is that at the end of the project
when the team is dispersed, they do not have a functional department (“home”) to which to return.
They need to be assigned to another project or get a job with a different employer.
. Answer A
Explanation In a functional organization, the project manager has the least support for the project
and has little authority to assign resources. Project expediter and project coordinator are roles in a
weak matrix organization.
. Answer B
Explanation This is an example of a change-driven project that cannot be planned up front since
there is a high level of uncertainty about the technology and the product scope. While the team may
already know how to build an online course, they haven’t developed interactive games before, and they
don’t know which platform they will be using yet. The choice of a platform will affect how the content
is built and the features available to the developers. Change-driven teams are often faced with coming
up with a unique solution that has never been built before. If this were a hybrid project, the team would
be using both predictive and agile approaches in a customized way. However, the scenario doesn’t
mention using any predictive methods, and that approach would require a higher level of certainty
than described here.
. Answer C
Explanation Because a project done in a matrix organization involves people from across the
organization, communications are more complex.
. Answer B
Explanation In a functional organization, the team members report to the functional manager. The
project manager probably reports to the functional manager as well.
. Answer D
Explanation A hybrid approach to project management uses both predictive and agile approaches,
but that doesn’t mean both approaches are used in every iteration. It also doesn’t mean that upfront
planning is done predictively while implementation is done in an agile way. Although it’s possible that
every part of the project will use either agile or hybrid practices, a hybrid of the two approaches may
be used instead. There is no set deﬁnition of how to do a “hybrid” project. Each hybrid project must be
customized based on the needs of the project and the organization.
. Answer A
Explanation The project coordinator reports to a higher-level manager and has authority to make
some decisions. The project expediter has no authority to make decisions.
. Answer D
Explanation “It repeats itself every month” implies that the whole project repeats every month.
Generally, the only things that might repeat in a project are some activities. The whole project does
not repeat. This is more likely a characteristic of ongoing business operations.
. Answer A
Explanation Organizational project management (0PM) provides a framework and direction for
how projects, programs, portfolios, and organizational work should be done to meet the organization’s
strategic goals.

T w 0
Framework

Explanation The scenario says that the business goal is enhanced customer experience as measured
by feedback surveys, not revenue enhancement. Therefore, comparing pre— and post—project revenue
won’t measure the value delivered. Also, it won’t be helpful to divide the expected improvement by
the number of releases, since each release will include diﬁerent features. Assessing the results after all
the releases are done will not measure the value being delivered incrementally throughout the project.
So the best option is to review the metrics against predeﬁned targets (documented in the quality
management plan) after each release. This allows you to monitor value delivery throughout the project.

Explanation The project charter is needed before planning and execution of the work can begin.
Therefore, it is created and approved in project initiating.

Explanation Notice the question asks which is not an input to project initiating. Did you read it
correctly? Companies should have processes in place for hiring resources, reporting, and managing
risks on projects (to name only a few). These are inputs to project initiating, as are company culture
and historical WBSs. The project scope statement is an output of project planning.

Explanation To answer this type of question, look for the choice that occurs closest to the process
group you are in. The project charter is created during project initiating. Completing work packages is
done during project executing. Validating scope and performing integrated change control are done
during project monitoring and controlling. Starting to create management plans is the best choice, as
it is part of project planning.

Explanation It is true that agile methods break down the work into small chunks, but so do predictive
or plan-driven methods and this is not why planning continues throughout the project. Since every
project begins with a recognised need or problem, an agile sponsor or product owner knows what they
need—they just might not know what a feasible solution will look 'ike until they see a prototype in
action. While agile teams do prioritize tasks that deliver value, agile teams continuously plan the work
throughout the project because these projects are inherently subject to uncertainty and high rates of
change that make upfront planning ine "i cient or impossible.

Explanation Did you notice that planning and executing are the only process groups oﬁered as
choices?I Therefore, design and integration can be eliminated as options. Doing the actual work (in
executing) will generally take the most project time and resources.

Explanation Project managers should be proactive. The only proactive answer here is preventing
unnecessary changes.

Explanation A change management plan includes the processes and procedures that allow smooth
evaluation and tracking of changes. Lessons learned are reviews of the processes and procedures after
the fact— to improve them on future projects.

Explanation The correct answer is that the team is using planning poker to determine the relative
size in story points of the stories for this release. The answer that refers to "how long it will take to
complete the ﬁrst iteration” must be incorrect, since agile iterations are timeb oxed; the iteration length
isn’t dependent on the amount of work. The other two options refer to release planning, which isn’t
covered by planning poker. (You may also have noticed that the three incorrect options all describe
duration. However, planning poker estimates measure eﬂort, not duration.)

Explanation The Develop Schedule process includes all work and uses all inputs needed to come
up with a ﬁnalized, realistic schedule. As part of the Estimate Activity Durations process, reserves
are created to cover identiﬁed and unknown schedule risks. All the other items are parts of Control
Schedule and occur after the Develop Schedule process.

Explanation The schedule management plan is the most correct answer. It includes plans for how
schedule changes will be managed.

s I x
Schedule

Explanation Detailed cost estimates have nothing to do with the situation described. Project
management plans include more detail than is necessary for the situation described, and may distract
from the conversation if used in this situation. Bar charts are most effective for reporting to the team.
The best answer is milestone reports, which present the right level of detail for upper management.

Explanation The formula BAC/ CPI is used to calculate EAC if no variances from the BAC have
occurred or if you will continue at the same rate of spending (as calculated in your cumulative CPI).
. Answer C
Explanation When you look at earned value, many of the terms have similar deﬁnitions. This could
get you into trouble. EAC means the estimate at completion. What it will cost to ﬁnish the project is
the deﬁnition of ETC, or estimate to complete.
. Answer D
Explanation The formula is CV = EV — AC. Therefore, CV = 350 — 400, or CV = —50. PV is not a
factor in this calculation.
. Answer D
Explanation Presenting anything other than your original estimate (allocating more to the budget) is
inaccurate and calls into question your competence and integrity as a project manager. The customer
should list potential changes and risks related to your estimate. If the costs and risks are justiﬁed, you
can ethically increase the budget.
. Answer C
Explanation Analogous estimating is used most frequently during project initiating and planning, not
project executing. Parametric estimating involves calculations based on historical records. Analogous
estimating early in the project uses top-down estimating techniques.
. Answer C
Explanation Since agile emphasizes keeping teams stable, the team’s burn rate should be consistent
over time. So all you need to update your projection is the latest estimate of how long the project is
expected to take. Of the options offered here, the only one that will show you a projected completion
date based on the latest project data is the burndown graph. The release plans might tell you when the
project was originally expected to ﬁnish, but that information might be out of date. The pro duct backlog
and the resource management plan won’t show completion dates. (Also, the resource management
plan is prepared by the project manager, not the team.)
. Answer B
Explanation This question is asking, “When you ﬁnish estimating costs, what do you have?” Many
people who do not realise that estimates should be in a range choose that option. Documentation
of assumptions is included in the basis of estimates, which is an output of Estimate Costs. The
prevention of inappropriate changes is more correctly part of the cost management plan and the
change control system.
. Answer B
Explanation Based on the data provided, we can project that the total cost of the team for this project
will be $496,000 (620 story points / 20 points per weekx $16,000 per week). However, the question
asks for the remaining cost of running the team, and they have already completed 120 story points
over 6 weeks, at a cost of $96,000 (120 / 20 x $ 16,000). So the correct answer is $400,000. (A simpler
way of ﬁnding this answer is to subtract the completed work from the total scope, and just calculate
the burn rate based on that number: 620 — 120 = 500; 500 f 20 x $16,000 = $400,000.) Note that the
information about the original cost estimate isn’t necessary for answering the question, although it
do es provide a way to check your calculation by comparing it to the original cost estimate.

Answer B
Explanation Asking percent complete is not a best practice since it is usually a guess. If the easiest
work is done ﬁrst on a project, it can throw off any percentage calculations of work remaining. The
life cycle cost cannot be lower than the project cost, as the life cycle cost includes the project cost.
Focusing on the amount spent last month and what will be spent in the next month is often done by
inexperienced project managers. Not only do es this provide little information, but the data cannot be
used to predict the future. Earned value analysis and other calculations is the best answer since this
choice looks at the past and uses that information to estimate future costs.
Answer D
Explanation The CPI is less than one, so the situation is bad. The project is only getting 89 cents out
of every dollar invested.
Answer A
Explanation Parametric estimates use a mathematical model to predict project cost or time.
Answer D
Explanation This estimate has a wide range. It is done during project initiating, when very little is
known about the project.
Answer C
Explanation A cost baseline is an output of the Determine Budget process.
Answer B
Explanation Setup costs do not change as production on the project changes. Therefore, they are
ﬁxed costs.
Answer D
Explanation Value analysis seeks to decrease cost while maintaining the same scope.
Answer D
Explanation You need the WES to deﬁne the activities, the network diagram to see the dependencies,
and the risks to determine contingencies. NOTE: These are high-level risks, not the detailed risks
that are identiﬁed later in project planning. Change requests are not required to obtain estimates,
although they could cause existing estimates to be adjusted. Without the other three choices, you
cannot develop good estimates.
Answer A
Explanation Because you need project details to estimate this way, the effort expended will be greater
with bottom—up estimating.
Answer A
Explanation It can be confusing to differentiate earned value terms from each other. The estimated
value of the work actually completed is the deﬁnition of EV. or earned value.

Before you read this chapter, think about the quality
management plan on your project. If you do not have a
quality management plan, or if you do not manage
quality now, this could be a difﬁcult topic for you on the
exam. This chapter will help you understand quality
and its role in the project management process.
Projects and organizations determine their
approach to quality management. For some, that may
mean simply responding to customer complaints about
the quality of deliverables. Others inspect their
deliverables for quality before they reach the customer.
More informed organizations not only inspect their
deliverables, but also evaluate and adjust their quality
management processes in an eﬁbrt to identify the
causes of defects. An even better approach includes
these quality management and process improvements,
as well as planning quality into projects. Ideally, an
organization embraces all these efforts as part of a total
commitment to providing the required level of quality.
This chapter will improve your understanding of the
efforts required to address quality at the most
effective level.
If asked, ”Is it better to plan in quality or to inspect
to ﬁnd quality problems?” almost everyone will answer
correctly that it is better to plan in quality. Exam
questions focus on situations to see if you know how to
apply this knowledge. For example:
The project manager ﬁnds that one of his team
members has created their own process for
installing hardware. What should the project
manager do?
Beginning project managers might choose a
response that relates to thanking the team member
for the effort. More experienced project managers
might select a choice that relates to ﬁnding out if the
process was a good one. The more experienced project
managers who also understand these quality processes

DBIIHIIIOH DI Quality
What is quality? Quality is deﬁned as the degree to which the project
fulﬁlls requirements. Nothing more, nothing less. Memorize this deﬁnition; it may help you get
more questions right on the exam.
Here is a story about quality. A student in one of RMC’s classes looked out the window during class
and noticed someone painting the limestone of an old building white. The student said, “That is not
quality!” Let’s think about the student’s statement for a moment. Why would such painting not be “quality”?
If the painting contract required the painter to use a certain kind of paint and follow painting standards, and
he was doing so, the work met the quality requirements. The issue the student really had was that the
wonderful old stone was being painted instead of cleaned. In ether words, this was a disagreement with the
requirements, not the quality of the work.
Let’s examine another example of an issue with requirements. Imagine a project in which a large group
of truck drivers are required to use tablets with touch—sensitive screens. Prior to ﬂeet deployment and
during the test process, the project manager received the following comments in relation to some back—
and—forth exchanges between the product owner and the drivers: “Give it here, look, like this, you don’t
need to tap the screen so hard...” and "It’s not doing anything, it doesn’t work.” The project manager
realized the truck drivers’ hands were too rough and calloused for the capacitive touchscreens to work
correctly. Here, the requirements were gathered and initial development had been done with the product
owner alone, who has knowledge and understanding of supply chain and logistics, but did not have direct
experience with drivers, who might have been able to provide insight relating to touchscreen technology
during requirements gathering.
Let’s review the deﬁnition of quality again: the degree to which the project fulﬁlls requirements. In
a plan-driven, or predictive environment, can you achieve quality if you do not have all the stated
and unstated requirements deﬁned in the project scope statement and requirements documentation? Of
course not. This makes the requirements—gathering effort, the requirements documentation, and the
project scope statement very important to the quality management effort. In a change—driven, or adaptive
environment a project manager would capture quality requirements and acceptance criteria in user stories.
As user stories are prioritised, quality efforts will be planned in detail for releases and iterations. Short,
time-b oxed iterations ensure frequent retro spectives and daily stand-up meetings provide frequent oppor-
tunities to identify and rectify quality issues. In either case, you must be sure to have all stakeholders repre-
sented in the requirements-gathering process.
You may see situational questions on the exam that use the term “grade” in discussing quality. Grade
and quality are not the same concepts. Whereas quality is the degree to which a project (or deliverable)
fulﬁlls requirements, grade refers to a general category or classiﬁcation of a deliverable or resource that
indicates common function but varying technical speciﬁcations. For example, a low grade of concrete that
supports limited weight might be su "Icient for a project’s needs and could be of acceptable quality if it
meets the established quality requirements, such as having zero defects. Likewise, a high grade of concrete
intended to sustain more weight could be of unacceptable quality if it is mixed or poured to low standards,
or otherwise fails to meet the established quality metrics.
Definition Of Quality Management
Quality management includes creating and following organiza-
tional policies and procedures and tailoring them to ensure the project also meets the needs of the customer.
We could also say it means ensuring a project is completed in compliance with the project requirements.
Quality management includes the processes of Plan Quality Management, Manage Quality, and Control
Quality.

Quality means meeting requirements, not adding extras.
Quality should be checked before an activity or work package is completed.
Quality should be considered whenever there is a change to any of the project constraints.
Some quality activities may be performed by a quality department.
The project manager should :
- Determine the metrics to be used to measure quality before the project work begins.
— Deﬁne quality management processes for the project and have a plan for continuous
improvement.
— Recommend improvements to the organization’s standards, policies, and processes, which are
expected and welcomed by management.
— Ensure that authorized approaches and processes are followed.
— Ensure the quality standards and processes on the project are adequate to meet
quality requirements.

Explanation In a just in time environment, supplies are delivered when you need them and not
before. Therefore, you have little or no inventory.

Explanation When someone is given the job of project manager, they will have formal, reward, and
penalty power. But just having the position does not make the project manager either a technical or
project management expert. Expert power has to be earned.

Explanation This question is asking which of the following is the highest. Self—actualization is not
listed, so the next best choice is esteem.

Explanation Problem-solving (also referred to as collaborating) normally takes more time, but it gets
buy-in from everyone, generating a more lasting solution.

Explanation It is best to start this discussion informally. The project manager should also document
the problem and include a summary of the conversation with the team member. If informal
communication does not solve the problem, formal written communication is the next course of action.

Explanation An understanding of the receiver’s perspective allows the sender to direct the
communication to meet the receiver’s needs.

Explanation This information is found in the communications management plan.

Answer A
Explanation: The most popular tools agile teams use to share their progress with other project
stakeholders are the large visible displays of information known as information radiators. Memos are
ine "’icient. Stand-up meetings share information within the team but not outside it. Retrospectives
are primarily for the beneﬁt of the team—and they are focused on improving the team’s processes, not
sharing progress.
Answer B
Explanation Because of the diﬁerences in culture and the distance between team members, formal
written communication is needed.

Answer A
Explanation There are many choices that are reasonably correct. Look for the most immediate need.
Here, the team member is in a manufacturing environment. That means communications will most
likely be blocked by noise. It is best for the project manager to ask the team member to repeat back
what he says, to ensure the team member correctly heard what the project manager communicated.
Answer D
Explanation This is another question with more than one right answer. Would asking for something
in writing be the best way to communicate? In this particular situation, asking for the concern to be
put into writing might alienate the stakeholders. The issue log is where the issue should be listed, but
the situation does not say if the project manager knows what the stakeholders’ concern is. Therefore,
using the issue log cannot be the best choice. Why not make a presentation to all the stakeholders
regarding the status of the project? The concern was being voiced only by stakeholders A and B, so
it is unnecessary to involve all the stakeholders. This problem would likely require informal verbal
communication to discover the real problem. Arranging a meeting with the concerned stakeholders is
therefore the best choice.
Answer B
Explanation Since there is no information about the sponsor or his needs in this situation, focusing
on his needs cannot be best. The statement that successor activities should have been watched, rather
than the predecessors, is not a correct statement. A project manager should watch both predecessor
and successor activities. Attendance at the party and the issue at hand (the late results) are not related.
Often forgotten in communications management plans are the managers of team members (functional
management, in a matrix organization). Including the managers of team members in communications
planning, requirements gathering, risk management, and other areas of project management helps
make the project better. In addition, it helps the functional managers manage their resources eﬂ'ectively.
If the functional manager of the team member assigned to the predecessor activity had been included
in the project planning processes, he would have known when the team member was needed to do
work for the project and the impact, if any. of delay. The communications management plan should
also have included a method to communicate potential delays.
Answer D
Explanation Working with people from different cultures who may have different values and beliefs
necessitates an understanding of both basic deﬁnitions and areas of cultural impact. Project managers
need good interpersonal skills and a willingness to adapt to other cultures.

Let’s start this chapter with a story. A project manager
was working on a hardware and software installation in
an area where hurricanes are a relatively frequent
occurrence. Then a hurricane struck.
Not long after the hurricane was over, the project
manager was telling people what a great job his team
had done and how quickly they had recovered from the
disaster. Would you have been proud of yourself if you
were the project manager? Before you answerJr consider
the following information:
'I The activity the team was working on required
three days to complete.
' The project manager had warning that the hurri-
cane was coming.
'I They had to recover from the disaster.
Instead of being excited ab out how quickly his
team was able to recover from the hurricane, the project
manager—and the sponsor—should have questioned
the wisdom of scheduling the implementation at a time
when there was a strong probability of a hurricane
happening or keeping to that schedule if the hurricane
prediction had come after scheduling was complete.
A project manager’s work should focus on
preventing problems rather than on dealing with them.
Had the project manager performed risk management1
he would have considered the threat of a hurricane and
worked with his team to identify possible actions to
take if a hurricane was forecast during implementation
weekend. Then, when one was forecast, the team could
have responded according to the plan, probably moving
the implementation to another weekend and avoiding

RlSk management
Risk management is the process of identifying, evaluating, and planning responses
to events, both positive and negative, that might occur throughout the course of a project. Through risk
management, you increase the probability and impact of opportunities on the project (positive events),
while decreasing the probability and impact of threats to the project (negative events). Risks are identiﬁed
and managed starting in initiating and planning. While the project is underway the project manager and the
team look at what has happened, the project’s current status, and what is yet to come—and reassess the
planned risk strategy.
Good risk management directly aﬁects a project manager’s ability to realize the beneﬁts and objectives
of a project. In fact, the concept of risk is closely related to value, so much so that we can think of negative
project risks (threats) as anti-value—factors that have the potential to erode, remove, or reduce value if
they occur. If value is the “heads” side of a coin, then risk is the “tails” side. Think of the value you create
with your project as deposits into a bank account. Risks, or at least threats that actually occur and become
an issue, are similar to withdrawals (or outﬂow). To create the most value, maximinze the deposits and
minimize the withdrawals.
Given the iterative nature of project management, a response strategy for a newly discovered risk may
create other project risks, which must be identiﬁed and managed. Be prepared for exam questions that test
your knowledge and understanding of risk management’s ongoing nature.
Threats and Opportunities
A risk event is something identiﬁed in advance that may or may not happen.
If it does happen, it can have positive or negative impacts on the project. Project managers often just focus
on threats—what can go wrong and negatively impact the project. Do not forget that there can also be posi—
tive impacts— good risks, called opportunities! Opportunities can include such things as:
i If we can combine orders for the ZYX equipment to buy more than 20 items at once, the cost will be
2.0 percent less per item than planned.
' If we provide a training class to improve e ”sciency, work package number 3 .4 could be completed two
days faster than expected.
I If we can obtain a resource with more experience and a higher level of productivity, work on the
critical path activity 4.7.2 could be done 10 percent faster.
The vast majority of the threats identiﬁed and investigated can be eliminated by changing how the
project work is planned and performed. Strategies such as using an adaptive life cycle, outsourcing some or
all of the work, or selecting more skilled people within the organization to do the work may reduce risk on
a project.
Uncertainty
Uncertainty is a lack of knowledge about an event that reduces conﬁdence in conclusions
drawn from the data. The work that needs to be done, the cost, the time, the quality needs, the communica-
tions needs, etc., can be uncertain. The investigation of uncertainties may help identify risks. Agile uses a
tool called a spike?" (or special iteration) in the development process to explore uncertainty. A spike is a
short eEort (usually timeboxed) that is devoted to exploring an approach, investigating an issue, or reducing
a project risk. Spikes often take the form of brief exploratory iterations (called a risk-based spike) or proof-
of—concept efforts (called an architectural spike) that are done at the start of a project, before the main
development effort begins.
Spikes can help a project manager reach a condition known as fast failures: failing quickly and early
before failure becomes more costly. As long as failure is quickly determined and the whole project hasn’t
been based on the failed approach, the project manager can move forward. Figure 1 1.1 illustrates how fast
failure can beneﬁt a project.

Managing from there is a matter of implementing planned responses for these risks that occur and
monitoring to decide what strategy changes are needed, which includes evaluating the eﬂectiveness of risk
responses that have occurred, planning for new risks that are identiﬁed, and reevaluating the portions of the
budget set aside for risks (reserves).

Many people confuse qualitative and quantitative risk analysis. Remember fer the exam that
OF THE
qualitative risk analysis is a subjective evaluation, even though numbers are used for the rating.
TRADE
In contrast, quantitative risk analysis is a more objective or numerical evaluation j the rating of
each risk is based on an estimate of the actual probability and amount at stake (impact). Therefore, while
the rating fer a risk in qualitative risk analysis might be a 3 (on the subjective scale of 1-5), that same risk
might be quantiﬁed as a $40,000 cost impact in quantitative risk analysis.
Plan Risk Management PAGE 401
The project manager, sponsor, team, customer, ether stakeholders, and experts maybe involved in planning
risk management. Part of planning invelves determining at a high level the amount and areas of potential
risk on the project. Risk management eﬂorts should be appropriate net only to the size and complexity of
the project but also to the experience and skill of the project team. Although risk checklists from previous
projects can be helpful in creating a plan and identifying risks, each project’s process should be tailored.
The Plan Risk Management process answers the question of how much time should be spent on risk
management based on the needs of the project. This includes evaluating the risk appetite of management
and other key stakeholders and identifying who will be involved and how the team will go about performing
risk management. Organizational procedures and templates related to risk, such as standard probability
and impact matrices, are identiﬁed and adapted.
When you have completed risk management planning, you should, of course, have a risk management
plan. Your risk management plan may include:
' Risk strategy This is an overall approach to managing risk throughout the life of the project.
1' Methodology This deﬁnes how risk management willbe performed to meet the needs of the speciﬁc
project. Low priority or low risk projects will likely warrant less of a risk management effort than high
priority or high—risk projects.
I Roles and responsibilities This section explains who will do what risk management work. Did you
realize that the project manager does not do it all and that stakeholders outside the project team may
have roles and responsibilities regarding risk management?
' Funding There is a cost of doing risk management but overall risk management saves the project
time and money by avoiding or reducing threats and by taking advantage of opportunities. This sec-
tion includes a plan for utilizing reserves in response to risks on the project.
' Timing This section speciﬁes when to do risk management depending on estimated timing for the
occurrence of identiﬁed risks. Also note that the needs to be allocated in the schedule for risk man-
agement activities.
' Risk categories These are discussed next in the Identify Risks section.
' Stakeholder risk appetite / thresholds The risk appetites and thresholds of key stakeholders are
documented and considered in the risk management plan. This information is also considered when
ranking risks based on probability and impacts, and when prioritizing which risks will be addressed
in risk response planning.

' Deﬁnitions of probability and impact Would everyone who rates the probability of a particular risk
a 7 on a l—to-lO scale in qualitative risk analysis mean the same thing? A person who is risk averse
might think of 7 as very high, while someone who is risk prone might think of 7 as a low ﬁgure. The
deﬁnitions and the probability and impact matrix (discussed later in this chapter) help standardize
these interpretations and also help compare risks between projects.
' Reporting This section of the plan describes what risk-related reports will be created, what they will
include, and to whom they will be sent. In addition, the composition of the risk register for the project
is deﬁned here.
I Tracking The tracking section describes how the risk management process will be audited and
how the results of risk management efforts will be documented.
Identify Risks PAGE 409
In this process, risks to the project and their characteristics are identiﬁed. This effort should involve all
stakeholders and might even include literature reviews, research, and communicating with non-
stakeholders. Sometimes, the core team will begin the process and then other team members will become
involved, or there could be a special, dedicated risk team—a part of the project team focused on risk
management eﬁorts.
TRICKS
When you get a question about who should be involved in risk identiﬁcation, the best answer
is ”everyone”! Each stakeholder has a different perspective of the project and can provide
thoughts on opportunities and threats.
Project managers should begin looking for risks as soon as a project is ﬁrst discussed. In fact, an
assessment of overall project risk is included in the project charter. However, the major risk identiﬁcation
effort occurs during planning. The project manager will need to have skills to facilitate the identiﬁcation of
all risks (or as many risks as reasonably possible).
Because risk identiﬁcation primarily occurs during project initiating and planning, the exam has often
said that the major part of risk identiﬁcation happens at the onset of the project. But keep in mind that
smaller numbers of risks may also be identiﬁed later in the project. Risks should be continually reassessed.
For the exam, understand that risk identiﬁcation is also done during integrated change control, when
working with contracts, when working with resources, and when dealing with project issues.
RISK Categories
A standard list of risk categories can help ensure areas of risk are not forgotten on your
projects. These categories are broad, common areas or sources of risk that the company or similar projects
have experienced. They can include things such as technology changes, lack of resources, regulatory
hurdles, or cultural issues. Organizations and project management o ”ices should maintain standard lists of
risk categories that all projects can use as prompt lists to help identify and group individual project risks.
When leading risk identiﬁcation eﬁorts, you should make sure each category is considered. A risk break—
down structure (RBS) is a hierarchical chart (which looks like an organizational chart) that can help you
identify and document risk categories.
Research has shown over 300 potential categories of risk, including risks caused by:
The customer
Lack of project management effort (yes, a lack of project management effort can add risk)
Lack of knowledge of project management by the project manager and stakeholders
The customers customers
Suppliers
Resistance to change
Cultural differences

E L E V E N
Speciﬁc risk categories include but are not limited to:
" External Regulatory, environmental; or governmental issues; market shifts; problems with project
sites; etc.
' Internal Changes to schedule or budget; scope changes; inexperienced team members; issues with
people; sta ”lng, materials; and equipment; etc.
' Technical Changes in technology; technical pro cesses; or interfaces; etc.
' Commercial Customer stability; terms and conditions within contracts ; sellers; etc.
' Unforeseeable Only a small portion of risks (about 10 percent) are actually unforeseeable.
The following are additional examples of sources of risk:
' Schedule ”The hardware may arrive earlier than planned; allowing wnrk package XYZ to start three
days earlier.”
' Cost ”Because the hardware may arrive later than planned; we may need to extend our lease on the
staging area—at a cost of $20,000.”
' Quality ”The concrete may dry to our quality standards before winter weather sets in; allowing us to
start successor work packages earlier than planned.”
' Scope ”We might not have correctly deﬁned the scope for the computer installation. If that proves
true; we will have tn add work packages at a cost of $20,000.”
' Resources ”Our designer may be called away tn work on the new project everyone is so excited ab out.
If that occurs, we will have tn use someone else; and our schedule will slip between 100 and 275 hours.”
' Customer satisfaction (stakeholder satisfaction) ”There is a chance the customer will tell us they
are unhappy with the XYZ deliverable; causing at least a 20 percent increase in time to rework the
deliverable and test plans.”
TRICKS
Expect the phrases ”sources of risk” and ”risk categories” to be used interchangeably on
OF THE
the exam.
TRADE
In addition to risk categories; risks can be classiﬁed under two main types:
' Business risk Risk of a gain or loss
' Pure (insurable) risk Only a risk of loss (such as ﬁre; theft; or personal injury; etc.)
You may also see references to risks described as non-event risks, which fall under the
following categories:
' Variability Risks caused by the inability to predict future changes
' Ambiguity Risks caused by a lack of understanding
TDOIS ”sad to Identify RiSkS
The primary tools and techniques used in this process relate to data
gathering and data analysis. They include brainstorming ; interviewing ; documentation reviews ; root cause
analysis; analysis of assumptions; constraint analysis; SWOT (Strengths; Weaknesses; Opportunities and
Threats) analysis; and checklist analysis. In root cause analysis5 the identiﬁed risks are reorganized by their
root causes to help identify more risks. SWOT analysis” examines the project to identify strengths and
weaknesses as well as the opportunities and threats that could originate; and checklist analysis is most often
used with risk category prompt lists discussed earlier.

RlSk Categorization
Assigning risks to categories may be helpful when planning risk responses. It’s also
important to know that a risk breakdown structure allows a project manager to represent risk sources into
a chart-like structure, which can help answer questions such as "What will we ﬁnd if we regroup the risks
by category? By source? By work package?” Using risk categories may also allow a project manager to elimi—
nate several risks at once. Think about how useful it would be to have not only a subjective assessment of
the total amount of risk on a project, but also a breakdown of the risks that shows which work packages,
processes, people, or other potential causes have the most risk associated with them.
Probability and Impact Matrix”
A probability and impact matrix is a data representation technique
used to plot risks in order to sort and rate them to help determine which risks to promote to quantitative
risk analysis.
’lhe matrix template itself follows a simple and standard matrix design going from higher to lower
starting from the lower left corner and moving up and to the right on the axes, as shown in ﬁgure 11.2. But
because qualitative risk analysis is based on subjective evaluation, organizations frequently have a standard
rating system to promote a common understanding of what each risk rating means, as shown in ﬁgure 11.3.

RlSk Parameters Assessments
In addition to creating a short list of risks, qualitative risk analysis
includes identifying risks that should move more quickly through the process than others due to factors
that are referred to as risk parameters. Some examples of risk parameters include the following:
' Urgency The urgency parameter indicates if the risk is likely to occur soon (requiring the response
to be implemented quickly) or if the risk requires a particularly long time to plan a response. Urgent
risks may be moved directly or more quickly into risk response planning.
" Dormancy Dormancy is the anticipated time between when a risk occurs and when its impact is felt.
' Manageability and controllability The manageability and controllability parameter indicates the
level of di “lculty involved in dealing with an identiﬁed risk, should it occur.

are used to “p erform” the project many times to simulate results, can be extremely valuable. Traditionally,

sively shorter horizontal bars beneath represent lower—ranked risks. The resulting graphic resembles a

EXDBC’IBCI Monetary Value (EMU)
Expected monetary value can be used in several ways but is often used
to estimate the impact of a risk by calculating its probability (as a percentage) times its estimated cost.
EMV = P X I
Example: 65% x $40,000 : $26,000
The resulting EMV values for risks in a quantitative risk analysis are later summed to calculate
contingency reserves. Questions on the exam may ask "What is the expected monetary value of the
following?” Do the following exercise to give this a try! The exam could also ask you to calculate the
expected monetary value for cost, the expected value (or just “value”) for the schedule of a path, or the

' Trends in quantitative risk analysis As you repeat quantitative risk analysis during project planning
and when changes are proposed, you can track changes to the overall risk of the project and see
any trends.
' Initial contingency time and cost reserves needed (finalized in Plan Risk Responses) For exam-
ple, "The project requires an additional $50,000 and two months of time to accommodate the risks on
the project.”
' Assessment of overall project risk exposure Use overall project success (how likely it is that the
project will achieve all key objectives) and any variables that may still affect the project to fully under-
stand the overall risk exposure of the project.
' Possible realistic and achievable completion dates and project costs, with confidence levels,
versus the time and co st objectives for the project For example, “We are 95 percent conﬁdent that
we can complete this project on May 25th for $989,000.”
' Recommended risk responses After quantitative risk analysis is performed, the risk register may
include suggested responses to overall project risks and individual project risks.
Plan Risk Responses PAGE 437
The Plan Risk Responses process involves ﬁguring out, “What are we going to do about each top risk?" The
project’s risk responses may include doing one or a combination of the following for each top risk:
' Do something to eliminate the threats before they happen.
' Do something to make sure the opportunities happen.
' Decrease the probability and/ or impact of threats.
' Increase the probability and/ or impact of opportunities.
For the remaining (residual) threats that cannot be eliminated:
' Do something if the risk happens (contingency plans). Contingency plans should be measurable so
you can evaluate their effectiveness.
' Do something if contingency plans are not effective or are only partially eﬂective (fallback plans).
This is what risk management is all about. If a change to a team members availability is a top risk, you
can investigate the possibility of replacing that team member with another team member who has similar
skills. If a work package is causing a large amount of risk, you might look at changing the deliverable,
modifying the work to produce it, or removing scope from the project. There are always options to respond
to risks.
In addition to avoiding or exploiting risks, you and the team determine what to do about each of the
residual risks (those that cannot be eliminated or exploited through risk response strategies). This might
mean accepting these residual risks, or planning additional risk responses. You then assign the work
involved in the responses to risk owners—individuals who watch out for the occurrence of a risk and
implement preplanned responses.
When you are taking the exam, assume that all major potential problems that could have been
identiﬁed in advance as risks were determined before they occurred and that there was a plan for each risk.
With this in mind, the best answer to a question describing a major problem on the project will be the
choice that talks about implementing a contingency plan, rather than one that involves discussing possible
solutions to a problem after it has occurred. Many people have said that these types of questions were the
reason they failed the exam. They simply made the wrong choices in situational questions. Be sure to make
the transition to this way of thinking if it is unfamiliar to you.
Here are a couple of other points that can be tricky on the exam:

E L E V E N
I Can you eliminate all threats on a project? Remember that threats can be eliminated and opportunities
exploited, but the time and trouble involved in eliminating all the threats and exploiting all the
opportunities on a project would probably not be worthwhile.
' Did you know that qualitative risk analysis, quantitative risk analysis, and risk response planning
occur throughout the life of a project? As noted in other parts of this book, planning is iterative. You
need to review risks throughout the project, including while the project work is being done or when
checking results. Newly identiﬁed risks need to go through the risk planning process.
The primary input to this process is the risk register, which has been updated throughout the risk
management process and now includes a list of risks that have been qualitatively (and possibly quantitatively)
analyzed. The risks have been prioritized based on their probability and impact, among other factors. These
are the risks for which responses will be planned. The cost baseline describes the contingency reserve that
will be used in addressing identiﬁed risks. (See the discussion on reserves later in this chapter.)
RlSk Response Strategies
When completing risk response planning, a thorough analysis must be
done of the potential responses for each risk. Some of these risk response strategies, also known as risk
mitigation strategies or strategies for threats and opportunities, involve changing the planned approach to
completing the project, such as changes to the WES, quality management plan, resources, communica-
tions, schedule, or budget. Other strategies, called contingency plans, involve coming up with a plan to be
implemented when and if a risk occurs.
The choices of response strategies for threats include:
' Avoid Eliminate the threat by eliminating the cause, such as removing the work package or changing
the person assigned to do work. Avoiding the threat might even involve expanding the scope of the
project. Imagine, for example, there’s an estimated 75 percent likelihood of a threat occurring, but an
additional level of testing or an additional activity would likely prevent this threat, expanding the
scope of the project in this way would help avoid the threat.
On an overall project level, if the threat is beyond the organization’s risk threshold, the project
manager will need to take action to make the project acceptable. This could include removing pieces
of the project that are too risky in order to avoid cancelling the entire project.
' Mitigate Reduce the probability and f or the imp act of an individual or overall project threat, thereby
making it a smaller risk and possibly removing it from the list of top risks on the project. Options for
reducing the probability are considered separately from options for reducing the impact. Any reduc—
tion will make a difference, but the option with the most probability and)” or impact reduction is often
the option selected.
' Transfer (deﬂect, allocate) Make a party outside of the project responsible for the threat by pur-
chasing insurance, performance bonds, warranties, or guarantees, or by outsourcing the work. Here is
where the strong connection between risk and procurement (contracts) begins. In the world of prop-
erly practiced project management, risk analysis is completed before a contract is signed, and trans—
ference of risk is included in the terms and conditions of the contract.
Avoidance and mitigation are generally used for high-priority, high-impact risks. Transference,
escalation (discussed next), and acceptance (also discussed next) may be appropriate for low—priority,
low-impact risks as well as those with higher impact.
A response to pure riskslS—such as ﬁre, property damage, or personal injury—is to purchase
insurance. Insurance exchanges an unknown cost impact of a known risk for a known cost impact. In the
example of a risk of ﬁre, the cost impact of the risk is unknown depending on the extent of the ﬁre. But
when insurance is purchased, the cost impact of a risk of ﬁre becomes known; it is the cost of the insurance
and the deductible. Transferring the risk by purchasing insurance does not eliminate all impacts. There may
still be residual risks. For example, a project could experience schedule delays due to a ﬁre even if ﬁre
insurance was purchased, or the cost of damage caused by the ﬁre could exceed the amount of
insurance purchased.
Risk
385

386
E L E V E N
Transferring a risk will also leave some risk behind. For example, there is a risk that if the third party
has trouble, they could cause a schedule delay. So you still need to decide what to do about any such
secondary risks.
The choices of response strategies for opportunities include:
' Exploit (the reverse of avoid) Add work or change the project to make sure the opportunity occurs.
This could be on the individual project risk level or on the overall project risk level.
' Enhance (the reverse of mitigate) Increase the likelihood (probability) and/ or positive impacts of
the opportunity occurring. This could be related to the overall approach to scope and schedule,
resources used, and project replanning, as well as to individual project risks.
' Share Allocate ownership or partial ownership of the individual or overall project opportunity to a
third party (forming a partnership, team, or joint venture) that is best able to achieve the opportunity.
Response strategies for both threats and opportunities include:
' Escalate A threat or an opportunity should be escalated if it is outside the scope of the project or
beyond the project managers authority. Any risks that are escalated will typically be managed at the
program or portfolio level—not at the project level. Remember that escalated risk needs to be
accepted by the program or portfolio manager, at which point, data on the escalation is documented,
and the risk is no longer monitored at the project level.
' Accept Passive acceptance means to do nothing and to essential'y say, “If it happens, it happens.”
This leaves actions to be determined as needed (workarounds) if the risk occurs. Active acceptance
involves creating contingency plans to be implemented if the risk occurs and allocating time and cost
reserves to the project.
Whether responding to threats or opportunities:
" Strategies must be timely.
' The effort selected must be appropriate to the severity of the risk—avoid spending more money
preventing the risk than the cost of the impact of the risk had it occurred.
' One response can be used to address more than one risk.
" More than one response can be used to address the same risk.
' A response can address the root cause of risk and thereby address more than one risk.
' The team, other stakeholders, and experts should be involved in selecting a strategy.
Watch out for questions about communicating risk-related information on the exam! Your risk
response strategies must be communicated to the sponsor, management, and stakeholders. These parties
will need to know that you are in control of the project even if there is a problem, and they may need to
approve the resources to make the risk response strategies happen. Communicating about risk is essential
for gaining buy—in to the strategy.
11.3 Exercise Now let’s see if you can apply what you have learned. Identify the type of risk
response strategy (avoid, mitigate the probability, mitigate the impact, transfer, exploit, enhance
the probability, enhance the impact, share, escalate, or accept) being described. Write the answer in
your Exercise Notebook for each description.
Description

Explanation This question asks when a dedicated workshop for identifying potential risks would be
most worthwhile. On an urgent, time-sensitive project we wouldn’t be able to spare the time for such an
eEert. On a project with well-deﬁned technology and requirements, the risks might not be signiﬁcant
enough to justify gathering the stakeholders for a pre-mortem. The option “a project that will require
process tailoring” doesn’t really tell us anything about the project concerned, which means that it can’t
be the best answer to the question. A long-term, high-visibility project as the correct answer.

Answer B
Explanation Risks change throughout the project. You need to review risks at intervals during the
project to ensure noncritical risks on the watch list have not become critical.
. Answer D
Explanation Project status reports can be an input to risk management. However, when completing
risk management for the ﬁrst time, you would not have project status reports. Therefore, project status
reports are not always an input to risk management.
Answer A
Explanation If you know the risk thresholds of the stakeholders , you can determine how they might
react to different situations and risk events. You use this information to help assign levels of risk to each
work package or activity based on their probability and imp act.
Answer D
Explanation A contract is a tool to transfer risk. The project management plan could change to include
a modiﬁed WBS and new work packages related to mitigating risk. The communications management
plan could change as a way to address a risk. A change to the charter is a fundamental change to the
project and may require a major adjustment to all aspects of the project management plan. It is not a
common result of risk management efforts.
Answer B
Explanation A risk is only escalated if it is outside the scope of the project or beyond the project
manager’s authority, which is not the case in this scenario. Acceptance of risk means doing nothing (if
it happ ens, it happens, or contingency plans are created). Avoidance of risk means we change the way
we will execute the project so the risk is no longer a factor. Many people think of using insurance as a
way of decreasing impact. However. purchasing insurance transfers the risk to another party.
Answer C
Explanation If you cannot determine an exact cost impact of the event, use qualitative estimates such
as Low, Medium, and High.
Answer A
Explanation A risk list, process updates, and sensitivity analysis are not outputs of the Plan Risk
Responses process. Residual risks, fallback plans, and contingency reserves are all outputs of the Plan
Risk Responses process. making this the correct answer.
Answer D
Explanation Creating a workaround involves determining how to handle a risk that has occurred
but that was not included in the risk register. The project must be in the Monitor Risks process if risks
have occurred.
Answer C
Explanation Transference is a risk response strategy. Risk response strategies are determined in the
Plan Risk Responses process.
Answer C
Explanation This situation is occurring during project planning. Planning must be completed
before moving on. Determining the risk rating of the project is done during Perform Qualitative Risk
Analysis, and should have already been done. Project risk reviews occur during Monitor Risks. Adding
work packages that are part of the newly planned risk responses comes next in project planning. This
is an example of iterating the project management plan.





Procurement

A very experienced student in an RMC class was upset
about a situation at work. He had arranged a meeting
with a seller and the seller had not shown up. He
rescheduled the meeting, and the seller still did not
show up. When the instructor asked what kind of
contract he was working with, the student had to contact
his oﬂlce and found out that he had a ﬁxed-price
contract. The instructor then asked him where in the
contract it said the seller had to attend such meetings.
The student then determined that meetings were not
listed in the contract. Why would a seller attend a
meeting if he was not getting paid for it?
For some people, procurement management is one
of the hardest management areas on the exam. If you
have worked with contracts before, you might have to
ﬁne—tune your knowledge by learning new terms for
what you already do and by understanding the project
managers role a little better. If you are like many other
people, however, you may have little experience in
procurement, and you will have to spend more time in
this chapter. Here we walk you through the procurement
process and suggest ways you can most effectively
prepare for this topic on the exam.
Think about what procurement management1
means for a project manager. The basic procurement
management skills required include the ability to help
create, read, and manage contracts and any supporting
documentation.

Be prepared to see the terms “contract” and “agreement” on the exam. Contracts can be written
or verbal, are typically created with an external entity, and involve an exchange of goods or
services for (usually monetary) compensation. A contract forms the legal relationship between
entities, is mutually binding and provides the framework for how a failure by one side will be addressed
and remedied, in court if necessary.
The broader term “agreement” includes documents or communications that outline internal or
external relationships and their intentions. A contract is a type of agreement, but an agreement isn’t
necessarily a contract. Imagine that two divisions of a company want to combine resources to achieve a
shared objective. They would create an agreement, but likely not a contract. Examples of agreements that
are not contracts are the project charter and plan documents, internal service level agreements, memos or
letters of intent, letters of agreement, emails, and verbal agreements.
So what does this mean for you? How you communicate, escalate, and solve problems will vary
depending on whether your actions are governed by a contract or an internal agreement. For example,
notifying a seller of a default on a contract term or condition should be done through formal written
communication to create a record and ensure appropriate legal action can be taken if necessary. In
comparison, failure to meet a term of an internal agreement might be handled in a conversation followed
up by an email. Understanding whether a situational exam question describes an internal agreement or a
contract might help you select the right answer.
In this chapter, we primarily use the term “contract,” because the procurement process is used to
acquire necessary resources that are outside the project team and involve legal documents between the
buyer and seller.
If you have little or no experience working with contracts, you should obtain from your
company some sample contracts, requests for proposals, and the resulting sellers’ proposals.
Spend some time reviewing them. To help you understand contracts, it might be helpful to
contact your organization’s contracts, procurement, or legal department. The exam assumes
that you have a close working relationship with them, that as a project manager you have speciﬁc
involvement in the procurement process even if you do not lead that process, and that the procurement
process cannot occur without your involvement.

Task 3: Negotiate Project Agreements
Task 1 1: Plan and Manage Procurement
Although this task within the Examination Content Outline (ECO) maps most directly the processes
of Plan Procurement Management and Conduct Procurements, it’s important for you to understand that
there are many tasks that overlap with procurement. For example, part of deﬁning project scope is to
determine whether the entire scope can be completed internally, or if part of it will be outsourced. This
analysis results in make-or-buy decisions, which are directly related to project procurements. Managing
procurements is in turn essential to managing scope. Additionally, efficient communications and
stakeholder management, and the effective use of your interpersonal and team skills, along with conﬂict
management, all contribute to procurement management success and good procurement practices should
diminish project risk.

T w E L v E
Procurement
Procurement Fundamentals
Typically, procurement is a formal process to obtain goods and services. When a decision has been made
to buy goods or services, the project manager facilitates the creation of a plan for procurement, including a
strategy for how each contract will be managed and a description of the work to be done by each seller (a
procurement statement of work). Procurement management includes planning, conducting, and
controlling procurements (which may also be summarized as planning and managing procurement), and
includes negotiating and managing contracts.
Buyers and SBIIBI‘S
The company or person who provides goods and services maybe called a contractor,
subcontractor, supplier, designer, or seller. The PMB 0K3 Guide primarily uses the term "seller,” but the
exam may use any of these terms. The company or person who purchases the services is called the buyer.
Many companies are a buyer in one procurement and a seller in another.
TRICKS
If no point of view is mentioned in an exam question, assume you are the buyer. Read questions
OF THE
carefully to see if the situation described makes the buyer’s or seller’s point of view explicit.
TRADE” Make sure you know the actions that you would take as the project manager for the buyer. This
is important to understand for the exam because sellers and buyer’s perspectives and the impacts of many
situations are different.
TRlCKS For some projects, sellers will provide the full solution, rather than just augmenting a project
team with additional resources. For example, you might add contract developers to your
internal staff to help code software, or alternatively outsource all development work to an
external resource who would plan and manage all developers, testers, etc. Unless an exam question
indicates otherwise, assume the seller is providing all the work external to the buyer’s team rather than
supplying resources to supplement the team.
Procurement Process Overview
Assume for the exam that you have a procurement department that generally manages the process, but note
that it may also be referred to as the contracting, purchasing, or legal department. Managing procurements
requires legal knowledge and negotiation skills, and although project managers are not often expected to
take the lead in legal matters and negotiations, you must be familiar with these aspects of procurement. You
must also understand what the procurement experts need from you, provide them with that information
and work with them throughout the project life cycle.
Planning may include make—or—buy decisions, and preparing artifacts that control procurements as
procurement management is being conducted. A procurement statement of work (SOW) is combined
with contract terms to document the scope of work and legal relationship between the buyer and the seller.
These are at ﬁrst known as bid documents that are later sent to prospective sellers (more on bid documents
later in this chapter). For the 30% the procurement department may review the scope of the work for
completeness, and the project manager might add scope related to project management activities such as
speciﬁc reporting requirements or required attendance at meetings. The type of bid document used is
inﬂuenced by the contract type selected and the content within the procurement SOW'. As you will see later
in this chapter, different types of contracts require project managers to focus on different areas
of management.
Prospective sellers review the bid do cuments,1 develop a full understanding of what the buyer wants,
then assess any risks and determine whether they will submit a proposal. They may have the opportunity to
participate in a bidder conference or a pre—proposal meeting, and may be able to submit questions before

Most project managers will utilize an agile method if tailored cooperation between the project team
and the customer is required. This cooperation can help direct the team’s efforts toward delivering value-
adding features, and typically involves more overall trust in order to focus resources. Did you know that
using an agile approach may also require the customer to be more involved in providing feedback on
iteration deliverables, reprioritizing the backlog, and ranking the value of change requests against the
remaining work items?
Contract Types3
Many different types of contracts can be used to acquire goods and services.
Boilerplate contracts or agreements used within an organization are organizational process assets. The
procurement manager selects the contract type for each procurement based on the following considerations:
' What is being purchased (a product or a service)
i The completeness of the statement of work
i The level of effort and expertise the buyer can devote to managing the seller
' Whether the buyer wants to offer the seller incentives
' The marketplace or economy
' Industry standards for the type of contract used
Keep in mind that although the buyer initially proposes the contract type, the ﬁnal contract type is
subject to negotiation with the seller. The best contract type meets the needs of the procurement, results in
reasonable seller risk, and provides the seller with the greatest incentive for e '"lcient performance.
I"
TRICKS
Some contract types can be referred to by more than one name. This can make it di lcult to
learn the contract types. Start out by understanding the three main categories of contract
types, as shown in the following list. Then, when the exam asks a question relating to contract
type, ﬁrst see if knowing which category the contract is in helps you answer the question.
The three broad categories of contracts are:
' Fixed-price (PP)
' Time and material (TSIM)
' Cost-reimbursable (CR)
You must understand the contract types and be able to recognize the differences between them.
Situational questions on the exam may require you to recognize that the project manager’s responsibilities
and actions will vary depending on the type of contract being used. There may also be questions that
require you to pick the most appropriate contract type based on a particular situation. Think through this
section carefully!
Fixed-Price (FP)
A ﬁxed-price contract should be used for acquiring goods, pro ducts, or services with well-
deﬁned speciﬁcations or requirements. In general, with a ﬁxed—price contract, a clearly deﬁned statement of
work along with competing bids mean you’re likely to get a fair and reasonable price. This is one of the most
common types of contract, though it’s less likely to be used in something like information technology than
in construction. If the costs are more than the agreed-upon amount, the seller must bear the additional
costs. Therefore, the buyer has the least cost risk in this type of contract because the scope is well-deﬁned.
Note, however, that when ﬁxed-price contracts are entered into and the statement of work is not so Hriciently
detailed, claims and disputes over what is in and out of the contract create higher risk of cost overruns or
delay. The seller is most concerned with the procurement statement of work (S OW) in a ﬁxed-price con-
tract, since this will help them more accurately estimate time and cost for the work involved and determine
a price that includes a fair and reasonable proﬁt. The amount of proﬁt is not disclosed to the buyer. Types




Procurement
T w E L v E
422
Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) A cost plus ﬁxed fee contract provides for payment to the seller of actual
costs plus a negotiated fee (the seller’s proﬁt, usually a percentage of the estimated cost) that is ﬁxed before
work begins. The fee does not vary with actual costs , thus, the seller does not have an incentive to increase
or inﬂate costs.
Contract = Cost plus a fee of $100,000.
Note: The fee may be adjusted as a result of changes to the procurement statement of work.
Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) A cost plus incentive fee contract. The seller is paid for actual costs plus
a fee based on speciﬁc performance objectives stated in the contract. An original estimate of the total cost
is made (the target cost) and a fee for the work is determined (a target fee). The seller gets a percentage of
the savings if the actual cost is less than the target cost, or shares the cost overrun with the buyer.

Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) In a cost plus award fee contract, the buyer pays costs and a base fee plus an
award (a bonus) based on performance, determined in advance. This is a type of incentive contract.
Procedures must be in place in advance for determining the award to avoid the subjective judgment
of awards.
The cost to administer an award fee versus the potential beneﬁts must be weighed in the decision to
use this type of contract.

Cost Plus Fee (CPF) or Cost Plus Percentage of Costs (CPPC) A CPF or CPPC contract requires the
buyer to pay for all costs plus a percentage of costs as a fee.
In the United States, this type of cost-reimbursable contract is generally not allowed for federal
acquisitions or procurements under federal acquisition regulations, and it is bad for buyers everywhere.
Can you see why?
If proﬁt is based on a percentage of costs billed to the buyer, what incentive is there to control costs?
Say a seller must purchase materials from one of two suppliers, both of which meet quality requirements,
but one charges $4 per unit and the other charges $40. A seller might be tempted to choose the $40 per unit
charge to maximize proﬁt.

Stakeholders
T H I a T E E N
expectations that go unidentiﬁed will have major impacts across all constraints. Once captured,
expectations are analyzed and may be converted to requirements and become part of the project.
A difference between what a stakeholder thinks will happen and what actually happens might
cause conﬂicts, rework, and changes. Why wait for a change? Why not prevent as many changes as
possible by asking stakeholders what they expect and clarifying any expectations that are not accurate
or that are poorly deﬁned? This might involve walking stakeholders through what will occur to make
sure there are no undiscovered expectations or requirements that could be unrealistic.
' Determine their interest. It’s important to determine the level of interest each stakeholder has in the
project. Does the stakeholder care about the project? Are they likely to be engaged? Once you gather
and analyze that information, you can use it to plan out a strategy for maintaining or increasing that
stakeholder’s interest and level of engagement. You may also ﬁnd that certain stakeholders are espe-
cially interested in working on a particular part of the project—to learn new skills or prove their
skills— or that you need attention and support from a key stakeholder for deliverable reviews and
acceptance. A great project manager will determine each stakeholder’s interests and engagement
related to the project, and will structure the work, roles, and responsibilities to maximize engagement.
' Determine their level of inﬂuence. To some degree, each stakeholder will be able to negatively or
positively affect a project. This is their level of inﬂuence, and it should be identiﬁed and managed.
' Determine their level of authority. Each stakeholder’s level of authority will impact their effect on
the work and outcome of the project.
' Incorporate their values. Project priorities should align with stakeholder priorities. Project manag-
ers should not plan or initiate work that the stakeholders do not support or value.
' Plan to engage stakeholders. Project management focuses on planning before taking action. You
need to plan ahead! How will you keep stakeholders involved in the project? How will you engage
with them about their interests, inﬂuence, and expectations? How will you include them in project
decision-making?
' Plan how you will communicate with them. Planning communications with your stakeholders is
critical and is related to stakeholder engagement. How can you keep stakeholders involved and get
them to communicate their thoughts and concerns if you haven’t planned out how information will
be shared on the project? Remember that poor communications are the most frequent cause of prob-
lems on projects, so careful communication planning can help prevent problems.
' Manage their expectations, inﬂuence, and engagement. Involving stakeholders doesn’t end during
initiating or planning. You need to work with them and manage relationships throughout the life of
the project.
' Communicate with them. Stakeholders are included in project presentations and receive project
information, including progress reports, updates, changes to the project management plan, and
changes to the project documents, when appropriate.
'- Monitor communications and stakeholder engagement. Good communication and relationships
with stakeholders are critical to success, so it’s essential to monitor these two areas on the project. You
need to determine if and where communication and/ or relationships are breaking down, and then
adjust your approach as necessary.
TRICKS
A key to your success as a project manager is how you handle stakeholder relationships.

Stakeholders must be involved, and their involvement must be managed by the project manager.

That involvement may range from minor to extensive, depending on the needs of the project

Stakeholders

Explanation It is important to look for the choice that would solve the real problem. The most likely
root cause is that stakeholders were missed and, as a result, their requirements were not identiﬁed.
These stakeholders are new requesting changes to accommodate their needs. There is no reason to
think that training , management oversight, or a need for more processes are factors contributing to the
numb er of changes.
2.. Answer A
Explanation Stakeholders can be identiﬁed throughout the project. However, the earlier stakeholders
are identiﬁed, the better for the project. If all the stakeholders’ needs and requirements are taken into
account before plans are ﬁnalized and project work is begun, fewer changes will be needed later in the
project, when they will be more costly.

Explanation A shared understanding of the project’s vision and goals is essential for a change—driven
team to successfully deliver value. The project manager should watch out for the gulf of evaluation and
make sure that the team isn’t misinterpreting the desired outcome or going off in a different direction
based on their own assumptions. Since agile teams are self-organizing and self—directing, the project
manager shouldn’t need to manage the team’s interactions with other stakeholders or make sure they
are busy all the time. While change—driven team members are empowered to solve their own problems,
that doesn’t mean that the project manager should ignore them.

F O U R T E E N
'llais chapter serves as a review of some of the key things you need to understand as you prepare for
the exam. Now that you’ve studied each topic individually; let’s put your knowledge and understanding
all together. Rita’s Process ChartTM is one way to connect the concepts in this hook. Ifyou worked through
the exercises in the "Processes and Domains” chapter, you should understand the overall project manage-
ment process, including all the eﬂ'orts involved in it. Ifyou skimmed over these exercises, go back and spend
time on them. You should also know the commonly occurring terms and concepts covered in the
“Framework” chapter. Understanding these terms and concepts will help you understand how each of
these things relate to the overall project management process.
As you work through this chapter, take this as an opportunity to ﬁnd any remaining gaps in your
knowledge so you are prepared to pass the exam on your ﬁrst try.
Putting It All Together
Over the next several pages, we review some of the frequently occurring terms and concepts you need to
understand for the exam.
organizational Process Assets How many times have you seen the term "organizational process assets"
in this book? Do you understand what it really means? Organizational process assets are an organization’s
existing processes, procedures, and historical data that inﬂuence the way a project is managed. With this
deﬁnition in mind, can you see why organizational process assets are inputs to many of the individual
project management processes from initiating to closing?
Enterprise Environmental Factors Enterprise environmental factors are also frequent inputs to project
management processes. Think of enterprise environmental factors as a company’s culture and existing
systems that the project will have to deal with or can make use of. Enterprise environmental factors are
outside the control of the team and may originate from within the organization or from external sources.
Enterprise environmental factors could include the culture, mission, and values of the organization, as well
as governance factors external to the organization.
Management Plans (for Each Knowledge Area) Planning is a key step in addressing the knowledge
areas of scope, schedule, cost, quality, resource, communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholders, as
well as plans for conﬁguration management, change management, and requirements management. It is a
crucial part of a project manager’s job. These plans are vital tools that empower team members to take
responsibility for their actions, work, and participation. It's important to note that these areas of planning
may occur within agile and hybrid environments as well but may be less formal These plans address the
majority of questions and concerns that might come up throughout the life of a project, and they allow the

project manager and team to spend more of their time completing the work of the project and less time
dealing with problems.
Project Management Plan The project management plan is described in the "Integration” chapter and
discussed throughout this book. This plan contains the blueprint for the project. It is an input to many plan-
ning, executing, and monitoring and controlling processes, as well as the Close Project or Phase process.
Work is compared against the plan to ensure that the correct work is being accomplished. Because the plan
is the blueprint for the project, it is maintained throughout the project, and it is updated when there are
changes. Therefore, project management plan updates are an output of most of the executing and moni-
toring and controlling processes, as well as some planning processes. (See the "Project Management Plan
Updates and Project Documents Updates” section in this chapter for more on this topic).
Baselines
The scope, schedule, and cost baselines help the project manager control the project. They
combine to create the performance measurement baseline for the project. How well the project is
performing in terms of scope, schedule, and cost is determined by comparing performance measurements
against these baselines. Change requests that affect the baselines mustbe approved in the Perform Integrated
Change Control process before the baselines can be changed.
Work Performance Data, Information, and Reports
The terms work performance data, work perfor—
mance information, and work performance reports diﬂ'erentiate the various stages of project data and infor—
mation. Work performance data is made up of the initial measurements and details gathered during project
work (executing). When work performance data has been analyzed for conformance to the project manage.
ment plan during the controlling processes, it becomes work performance information. This information
can then be organized into work performance reports, which are distributed to stakeholders.
Expert Judgment Expert judgment, a frequently used tool of project management, refers to the knowl—
edge and experience of someone who has done the types of things necessary to complete the work for the
project. Although it is not often discussed in this book, expert judgment is used throughout the project in
every process, including every aspect of integration management. Expert judgment is particularly valuable
in planning a project and is a tool and technique for most of the individual planning processes.
Project Management Plan Updates and Project Documents Updates Updates to project artifacts are
frequent outputs of the project management processes across planning, executing, and monitoring and
controlling. Updates to the project management plan may include updates to any of the plan’s components.
Project documentation is updated to reﬂect adjustments, actions, and changes. In planning, updates include
iterations of the plan and lmowledge gained as planning processes are followed. In executing and moni—
toring and controlling, project documents are updated with work performance data and information.
These updates ensure everyone has a common understanding of the project as it progresses. They also allow
the project manager to relian use documentation to measure and control the project.
Change HBQUEStS
Change requests include recommended corrective and preventive actions and defect
repair. ’ﬂaey are outputs of some planning processes, most of the executing processes, and all the moni-
toring and controlling processes except Perform Integrated Change Control. Change requests are inputs to
Perform Integrated Change Control, where they are reviewed. The approved change requests (outputs of
Perform Integrated Change Control) are inputs to Direct and Manage Project Work and Control
Pro curements, where the changes are implemented. In Control Quality, the approved changes are veriﬁed
to make sure that they return the intended results.

Formulas to Know for the Exam
Although we do not suggest you memorize a lot of information to prepare for the exam, the following
formulas are ones you do need to memorize, as well as understand. The exam will not include a lot of
questions involving formulas, but knowing these formulas will enable you to apply them at a moment’s
notice. Ifyou are not comfortable with math, you will be happy to hear that you can know none of these
formulas and still pass the exam! The most important formulas are those relating to earned value because
earned value is a key component of monitoring and controlling.

iii-[iii Before You Take the Exam
TRADE.
Many people fail the exam because they did not properly prepare. You can avoid that mistake. Read the
following tips slowly, and honestly assess how each item applies to you:
I Know the material thoroughly, but do not approach the exam assuming it simply tests facts that you
must memorize. The exam tests knowledge, application, and analysis. You must understand how to
use all concepts and processes in the real world, including how they work in combination with each
other in the context of a large project.
I Have real-world experience using major project management tools and techniques. Ifyou do not have
this experience now; try to get it. Ifyou cannot get this experience before you take the exam, make
sure you can visualize how tools and processes would be used on real projects. This visualization will
help you understand the beneﬁts of using project management tools and techniques in the real world,
and help you prepare for situational questions on the exam.
I Think in terms of large, plan-driven projects when studying for and taking the actual exam. This will
help you remember the importance of processes, tools, and techniques that you may not be using in
your real—world project management. At the same time, be open to the ideas of tailoring, and agile and
hybrid approaches, as questions or situations may call for one of these approaches.
I Understand the areas that PM] emphasizes (PMI-isms, explained in chapter 1 and in the "Quality"
chapter).
I Be familiar with the types of questions you can expect on the exam, but do not be alarmed if you see
new types of questions when you take the exam.
I Be prepared to see situations on the exam that may be ambiguous and wordy Practice interpreting
these types of questions using the practice exams or PM FASTrack' if you have it.
I Ifyou have PM FASTrack', practice using analysis to select the best answer from what appears to be
two or more "right” answers. (See the next section for more information.)
I Decide in advance what notes you will write down at the beginning of your exam. This may include
formulas or gaps in your project management knowledge. Practice creating this "download sheet"
before taking the exam. (See the next section for more information.)
I Deal with stress before you take the exam. Ifyou are a nervous test taker, using PM FASTrack‘ can
give you an opportunity to practice stress controL
I Plan and use a strategy for taking the exam. This may mean you will take a mental break after every 50
questions, or that you will answer all exam questions as quickly as possible and then take a break
before you review; and potentially adjust, your answers.
I Expect that there will be questions you cannot answer or even understand. This happens to everyone.
Be prepared so you do not get anxious or doubt your abilities during the exam.
I Do not expect your exam site to be quiet. Ifyou have PM FASTrack', practice answering questions in
an environment that is not 100 percent quiet.
I Do not overstudy. Getting completely comfortable with all the material in this book is just not
possible. It is not worth studying for hundreds of hours. It is a waste of time and will not guarantee
you’ll pass the exam.

of stress is not allowing you to think. So what do you do? Ifyou do not immediately know the answer
to a question, leave it blank, or use the Mark for Review ﬁmction and come back to it later.
Control frustration, and maintain focus on each question. You might dislike or disagree with some of
the questions on this exam. You might also be surprised at how many questions you mark for review.
Make sure you stay focused on the current question. Ifyou are still thinking about question 20 when
you reach question 120, there willhave been 100 questions that you have not looked at closely enough.
Answer each question using your knowledge of project management good practices. Be prepared to
separate your experience from PMI’s perspective. Many people who failed the exam tried to answer
questions from their real—world experience. If an answer doesn’t come to you by applying good
practices of project management from PMTs perspective, then rely on your training. Ifthis still does
not help you answer the question, only then should you rely on your real-world experience.
First, identify the actual question in the words provided (it is often the last sentence), and then read
the rest of the text. Note the topics discussed in the question and in the descriptors. This should help
you understand what the question is asking and reduce the need to reread questions.
Carefully consider each answer choice listed and choose the best one of the choices given. Don’t read
into the answers.
One common reason people answer questions incorrectly is they do not read all four answer choices.
Do not make this mistake. Make sure you read the question and all four choices. This will help you
select the best answer. Ifyou ﬁnd yourself forgetting to read all answer options, start reading the
choices backwards (choice D ﬁrst, then C, etc.) .
There may be more than one "correct" answer to each question but only one "best" answer. Make sure
you are looking for the best answer.
There will be answer choices that are meant to distract you from the correct answer. These are
plausible choices that less knowledgeable people will pick. Such choices make it appear as though
some questions have two or more right answers. To many people, it seems as though there are only
shades of difference between the choices. As noted earlier, make sure you look for the best answer for
such questions, and think about the situation in terms of project management good practices.
Be aware that questions may also include irrelevant information.
Look for words and phrases such as “still,” “yet,” "ﬁrst’; "last,” “next,” I""‘e:I:cept,"" "not," I“most likely” "less
likely.” "primary," "initial," and "most.” Make certain you clearly read the question, and take note of
these words so you will answer the question correctly.
Watch for choices that are true statements but do not answer the question.
Watch for choices that contain common project management errors. They are intentionally there to
determine if you really know project management. You can combat this by looﬁng for errors in your
knowledge and correcting those errors as you go through this book. (See the "Common Project
Management Errors and Pitfalls" section in this chapter.)
Options that represent broad, sweeping generalizations tend to be incorrect, so be alert for words
such as "always,” “never,” "must,” "completely,” ”all,” and so forth. Alternatively. choices that represent
carefully qualiﬁed statements tend to be correct, so be alert for words such as "molten,"I “sometimes,"
"p erhaps," "may." and "generally.”
You may see some poorly worded or grammatically incorrect questions or answer choices on the
exam; don’t let this distract you.
Look for answers that support the value of project management with underlying messages such as,
"Ho oray for project management ! "; "The project manager is so important”; or "The “7135 is so useful."
They are generally the correct choice.

Answer There are a number of correct answers to this question. Let’s ﬁrst review what should not
be on your "Most” list, and then we will look at what efforts a project manager should focus on
during the course of a day. Think through the items listed here, and identify whether you have any
misconceptions about what you should be doing as a project manager. Ifyou do, you need to clarify
and ﬁx these misconceptions before you take the exam.
Items that should not be on your "Most" list:
I Dealing with problems and unexpected changes (rather than preventing them)
I Schedule and other items related to schedule management
I Meetings
I Micromanaging
I Completing work activities
The following items should have been included in your "Most” list:
I Using project management tools, such as a charter, WBS, and project management plan
I Measuring
I Recommending and taking corrective and preventive actions
I Doing risk management and implementing risk responses
I Coaching, mentoring, and team building
I Communicating and using active listening
I Managing by exception to the plan
I Interacting with stakeholders to maintain and improve stakeholder engagement
I Looking for possible changes



Endnotes
The following notes provide the historical background of many of the terms in this book. You do not need
to know this information for the exam. It is simply provided for your interest and reference.
CHAPTER TWO

## Answer C


Explanation “Scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk, resources, and customer satisfaction” is the most
accurate list of constraints, or competing demands, that a project manager must deal with.

Explanation The scope management plan and the WES focus on project scope. The communications
management plan addresses who will be communicated with, when, and in what format. The only
choice that addresses gathering, integrating, and disseminating information is the PMIS.

Explanation Because orders are numerous and of short duration, this situation is a recurring process,
not a project.

Answer B
Explanation Manufacturing a product is an ongoing process , it is operational work, not project work.
Therefore, the manufacturing team would have no reason to create a project charter and would have
diiﬁculty doing so if they tried because of the ongoing nature of the work. If the question referred to a
team developing a new product, however, that would qualify as a project.
Answer C
Explanation Because the question talks about priorities between projects, this cannot be the role
of the project manager, the project management team, or the project team. Determining priorities
between projects is a role of the PMO.
Answer C
Explanation A project is a temporary endeavor with a beginning and an end, a program is a group
of related projects, and a portfolio is a group of projects and programs related to a speciﬁc strategic
organizational objective. Remember to use the process of elimination, ruling out any answer that is
not completely correct.
Answer D
Explanation The best answer is stakeholders, as their input is critical for collecting all the lessons
learned on each project. The term "stakeholders” includes all the groups mentioned in the other
answer options.
Answer C
Explanation Remember, the internal rate of return is similar to the interest rate you get from the
bank. The higher the rate, the better the return.
Answer C
Explanation Remember the deﬁnition of a project: temporary and unique. Operations and
maintenance are considered ongoing activities, not temporary. Therefore, such work is not considered
a project or part of a project.
Answer B
Explanation Did you select ”a group of unrelated projects managed in a coordinated way”? If so, you
missed the word "unrelated.” Programs are groups of related projects.
Answer B
Explanation Lessons learned help to avoid future pitfalls and use the good ideas of past projects. This
leads to improvements in future projects. The organization beneﬁts from creating a lessons learned
repository.

The Project Life Cycle1
PAGE 19:
The project life cycle is how you organize doing the work of the project, and the project management
process is how you organize managing that work. Both are necessary to complete a project. This section
will cover both concepts.
The Life CYCIB and Development Approach
A life cycle is a progression through a series of
developmental stages. The project development life cycle2 reﬂects the performing organization’s
methodology for managing a project. It is a logical breakdown of what you need to do to produce the
project deliverables, and is selected based on factors such as the type of product being developed, the
industry, the organization’s preferences, and the development approach.
A project life cycle can use a plan—driven or change-driven development approach, or a hybrid of the
two. There are generally one or more phases, although the term “phases” will be qualiﬁed later in reference
to change-driven projects. An example of a life cycle for new product development might include the
following phases: research, design, build, test, and implement.
Plan-Driven PTDIBC’I Life Cycle
Plan—driven projects have predictive development (also referred to as
traditional, predictive, or waterfall) life cycles that require scope, schedule, and cost to be determined in
detail early in the life of a project—before the work begins to produce the project deliverables. For example,
a construction project would typically be managed using a predictive life cycle.

Change-Driven Project Life CYCIB
Change—driven prejects use iterative and incremental (alse referred
te as agile er adaptive) develepment life cycles, and have varying levels of early planning fer scep e, schedule,
and ce st. Incremental and iterative life cycles invelve early planning efhigh-level scepe sufﬁcient eneugh te

An incremental develepment life cycle delivers a cemplete, usable pertien ef the preduct fer each
iteratien. Fer example, a preject te build a website using an incremental life cycle weuld invelve prieritizing
requirements inte iteratiens that deliver a fully functiening pertien ef the website at the end ef

With an iterative develepment life cycle, the cemplete cencept is built in successive levels ef detail te

planning fer the ﬁrst iteratien weuld fe cus en planning te create a pretetype ef the entire website. After the
basic skeleten ef the site is built, each successive iteratien weuld be planned te add mere detail until a
cemplete and fully functiening site is achieved.
Adaptive develepment life cycles invelve a ﬁxed schedule as well as ﬁxed cests. Scepe is breadly
deﬁned with the understanding that it will be reﬁned threugheut the life ef the preject. The custemer’s
requirements are decumented and prieritized in a backleg, which can be adjusted as the preject pregresses.

Hybrid Development AppfﬂﬂCh A hybrid life cycle is a cembinatien ef a predictive and an adaptive
develepment appreach. With such an appre ach, a predictive life cycle is used te manage the preject require—
ments that are well deﬁned, while an adaptive life cycle is used te manage the requirements that are less

Remember that many of the same precesses and teels and techniques can be used en prejects using
varieus develepment life cycles.
Project Management Process Groups
There are a number ef ways te successfully manage a preject, as leng as it is managed with the disciplined
applicatien efgeed practices. Using and tailering preject management precesses is cennected te managing
a preject based en preject censtraints, the business envirenment, and the chesen develepment life cycle.

preject was selected and the value it premises if succefully cempleted. Preject censtraints are what

Per the exam, yeu need te understand preject management frem twe different but cerrespending

Processes and Domains
The overall process of project management may include managing a project using ﬁve process groups.
These process groups are presented in Figures 3.1 through 3.5. Figure 3.1 shows how the project
management process groups interact.
Key:
I = Initiating
P 2 Planning
E = Executing
Misc = Monitoring is controlling
C = Closing
FIGURE 3.1 Project management process
The overall process of project management interacts with the project life cycle. For small projects
following a plan—driven (or predictive) life cycle, you may go through the overall project management
process (initiating through closing) once for the entire project, although portions of the process may he
iterated or repeated throughout the project life cycle as shown in ﬁgure 3.2.

FIGURE 3.2 Smsilproject with a predictive life cycie
Large projects often require each life cycle phase to he managed through the project management
process groups. The example illustrated in ﬁgure 3.3 is for a large construction project. In this project, the
development life cycle phases of feasibility, planning, design, production, turnover, and start—up are all
extensive, requiring separate planning and management of each phase. This means there would he an overall
initiating effort in which the project manager would help create a charter and do high—level planning for the
entire project to get charter approval. Then, a separate initiating process for the feasibility phase would take
place, followed by a planning effort for that phase, the execution and control of that work, and, ﬁnely, a
closeout of the phase, which typically includes a handoff of deliverables — in this case, the results of the
feasibility analysis. This would then be repeated for each life cycle phase.

FIGURE 3.3 Large project with a predictive life cycle with phase gates (indicated by the vertical bars)
At the end of each phase, an event called a phase gatei may take place. A phase gate involves analyzing
the results of the completed phase against what was planned for that phase. Based on that analysis, options
may include redoing the same phase, moving forward with the next phase, or choosing not to continue with
the project. If the decision is made to move forward, the project would begin initiating work on the next
phase and progress through the project management process groups for that phase.
Projects may also be broken into phases and then into smaller releases and iterations within those
phases. The project management processes of initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling,
and closing are done for each phase. The level of detail and the time spent on each process group may vary,
but the entire project management process is typically followed, as indicated in ﬁgure 3.4, which depicts
the traditional process groups with an adaptive life cycle.

FIGURE 3.4 Large project with an adaptive life cycle
It’s important to know that agile approaches don’t include the use of the term "phase” as the traditional
“phase gate” approach is different from an adaptive environment in which iterations tend to be short in
nature and include retrospectives. Also be aware that the overall process is usually more ﬂexible and evolves
throughout the life of a project.
This may all seem somewhat complicated. Don't worry! For the exam, understand that there is a
project life cycle and a project management process. Read exam questions carefully to determine whether
the project life cycle or project management process is being discussed.
Some people think they need to understand a variety of industries to pass this exam. Although some
questions may refer to speciﬁc types of projects and industries (for example, ”You are building a bridge” or
"You are creating a new system for your comp any”), that is background information. The exam will not ask
you to select the nicorrect” project life cycle for a speciﬁc type of project, nor will it ask how to do work on
an IT, construction, or engineering project. The questions are general and can be answered without an
understanding of the industry—ifyou know project management.
You may, however, see questions that require you to understand how the project life cycle (plan-
driven, change-driven, or hybrid) is being used in a given scenario. The process groups do not change,
although there are variations in the level of attention and formality given to each, depending on the life
cycle.
The illustration that appeared in ﬁgure 3.1 is shown again here in ﬁgure 3.5 for your reference as you
read the rest of this section and think about the project management process in terms of the process groups.

Take time to fully understand Figure 3.5 before continuing. Consider the following hints and trick:
' Arrows moving clockwise from initiating indicate the process moving generally in order from
initiating through planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing.
' Double arrows between the planning, executing, and controlling process groups illustrate that you
often move back and forth between them depending on events taking place. New information that
becomes available while executing could bring you back into planning. For example, while a process
like Integrated Change Control (ICC) is a controlling process it addresses change requests made
during executing. You return to executing upon its completion to carry out approved changes and to
communicate ICC results.
i The single dotted arrow returning from monitoring and controlling to initiating indicates that, under
certain limited circumstances, you may enter initiating once you leave it (see ﬁgure 3.6).
' Have you noticed the shaded circle labeled M3<C enclosing the rest of the ﬁgure? Monitoring and
Controlling is being carried out from start to ﬁnish on the project. Work in all other process groups
takes place in the context of ongoing monitoring and controlling. This is an important concept to
remember for the exam.

One of the most important aspects of understanding the project management process groups
OF THE
is that while they are mainly classiﬁed as going in sequence, in reality there is a lot of overlap
TRADE
between the process groups at any given time. It is true that project management may occur in
a certain order, but at the same time project management is very dynamic, which means that managing a
project is not linear.
Figure 3.6 illustrates the reasons for entering project initiating. Figure 3.7 shows the reasons for
entering project planning.

The traditional approach to execution is to “go do the items identiﬁed in the project plan” and up date
the baseline if changes occur. These changes may be necessary due to changes in activity durations and
resource productivity or availability based on unanticipated risks and issues. There is an assumption that to
a certain extent planned activities are fully understood prior to starting work and are completed according
to the plan.
Agile methods employ a more dynamic execution approach in which additional efforts may be made
to replan some or all of a project. This is due to the complex nature of some projects that may require a lot
of change. This could occur because of a technical uncertainty or a change within a requirement, for
example. It is assumed that all aspects of work are not known in advance and learning with adaptation will
be necessary to complete these tasks.
Execution on an agile project occurs through multiple iterations. Each iteration is a short and focused
time period to undertake work followed by an interation review (including a pro duct demo with the
customer) and a team retrospective. The retrospective allows any issues with execution or scope changes to

T H n E E

be discussed in a timely fashion. It also acts as a review point to check progress against the plan and
determine if any changes to the project execution process, scope, or schedule are necessary.
Figure 3.10 illustrates key project outcomes that trigger a focus on monitoring and controlling. It also
shows that you might go from monitoring and controlling to other process groups depending on the needs
of the project.

FIGURE 3.10 Key outputs that triggerprojest monitoring and controlling, and potential next steps
Test takers often ﬁnd project monitoring and controlling to be particularly challenging on the exam.
One reason for this is that you are expected to know how to observe, measure, evaluate, and analyze a
project in a more complete and systematic way than many project managers have experience with.
Monitoring and controlling applies to change-driven and plan-driven projects, but it is useful to think
in terms of plan—driven projects to understand the work of this process group and to answer questions on
the exam. High-change environments often handle evaluating and approving project changes differently
through the product owner role. By putting the product owner in charge of the backlog, agile approaches
delegate the authority for local decision making to this embedded team member to streamline the process.
The overall view of Monitoring and Controlling within the ﬁve process groups is similar to a thermostat
model. Once the plan is made, measurements are used to determine if adjustments during execution are
necessary when feedback indicates acceptable tolerances have been exceeded. Agile approaches use
different techniques for monitoring, with more demos and feedback rather than tests to speciﬁcation.
These demos and business discussions are more subjective, but eventual success is often a subjective measure.
In addition to the thermostat model of feedback, experimentation and learning are a key part of the
process for change-driven projects. The iteration review and the retrospective that follow an agile iteration
are visible components of an experimentation and learning model in play. Iterations can be created to try
new technology or test new process changes in addition to building new functionality. These short cycles
provide important feedback on what is working and what needs further tuning.

Because it can seem like a lot to absorb and comprehend, this chapter and the remaining
chapters, along with the Tricks of the Trade that we’ve included; will help you gain the knowledge you
need to fully grasp the material included in this book.
Rita’s Process ChartTM is not intended to map to other project management resources; instead, its
function is to state, simply and directly, the efforts that are involved in managing a project. Understanding
these efforts will provide the project management context you need for the exam.
HOW to USB Rita's PI'OCBSS CI‘IEIITTM
As you review Rita’s Process ChartTM, make sure you:
' Understand the overall project management process (a PMI-ism).
' Find terms you do not know, and learn what they are by looking them up in this book.
i Know why each item is in the column (process group) it falls into.
" Understand the project management process groups of initiating through closing. including when
each eﬁort should be done on projects. The exam asks questions that present a situation and require
you to know which process group the project is in.
' Are able to replicate the speciﬁc order of the planning activities by understanding what happens
when, how previous work supports what comes next, and why; knowing Rita’s Planning column in
this order can help you get a large number of questions right on the exam because the exam often asks
what should be done next. The work in the other process groups does not have a set order. Use Rita’s
Process ChartTM Game (discussed later in this chapter) for this.
' Understand that project planning is an iterative process. Consider how you might go back and redo
(iterate) some of the items in the Planning column to reﬁne the plan for a large project. Or think
about how rolling wave planning would be used on a large project to reﬁne and detail plans for each
phase as you move through the life cycle of a project.
' Complete Rita’s Process ChartTM Game at least three times. Going through the game will solidify
your understanding of the overall project management process and help you ﬁnd gaps in your
knowledge. Focus your study on those gap areas so you understand the processes before taking
the exam.

Notes on the Chart
Initiating
Do you remember the project selection process from the “Framework" chapter? Do you know why
your project was selected? Does it matter? It will inﬂuence how the project is planned, what kinds of
changes are allowed, and how the project scope is deﬁned. The business case and the beneﬁts
management plan are inputs to developing the charter. (See the “Develop Project Charter” discussion
in the "Integration” chapter for more about the importance of project business documents.)
Notice the phrase "Understand business case and beneﬁts management plan.” This could be read as
“Understand the reason the project is being done and what beneﬁts the organisation expects to gain
as a result of it." These business documents will guide all project management activities to ensure the
project is worth the investment and that it will return the expected beneﬁts to the organization. This
is a major concept on the exam that many project managers miss.
As the project manager, you should understand why your project was selected and what beneﬁts it is
expected to deliver. Is the project being done so the organization can enter a new market? Is it
intended to meet a regulatory requirement? Is it the result of a customer request? Is it just a priority
project for a comp any executive? Is it expected to dramatically improve the future of the company? If
you lose sight of the objectives, the project may ﬁnish on schedule and on budget but still fail because
it does not achieve those objectives or does not deliver the expected beneﬁts.
Team building, risk identiﬁcation, stakeholder identiﬁcation, risk response planning, and many other
activities primarily occur in the process groups in which they are placed on the chart, but these
activities can start in initiating and continue until closing.
Identifying and analyzing stakeholders help to align their expectations about the project and assess
their potential involvement and inﬂuence on the project.
The project manager determines whether the project objectives can be achieved and if it is likely to be
completed within the given constraints. High-level planning is summarized in a project charter, which
documents high-level estimates, measurable objectives, success criteria, milestones, and an initial
budget. Initial planning may also include creating a high-level WBS and doing high-level
risk identiﬁcation.
The charter, once formally approved by the sponsor, gives the project manager the authority to
continue the project beyond initiating. It also provides a guiding vision of the project’s business case
and beneﬁts management plan (the project’s reason for being), and the organization’s
Strategic objectives.
Besides an approved charter, an outcome of initiating is the stakeholder register.
Planning
After the project charter has been approved, detailed planning begins. In the Planning column, note
the ﬁrst box: n‘D etermine development approach, life cycle, and how you will plan for each knowledge
area.” Each knowledge area (scope, schedule, cost, etc.) requires management plans as well as
additional plans for conﬁguration, change, and requirements management. The ﬁrst thing you need to
do as you start planning is ﬁgure out how you are going to plan, execute, and control for each
knowledge area. This will guide the rest of your planning efforts.
The project manager and team perform a more detailed analysis of whether the objectives in the
project charter and the expected business beneﬁts can be achieved. They determine what processes
are appropriate for the needs of the project and tailor processes to those needs.
Notice the phrase “D etermine team charter and all roles and responsibilities.” Determining roles and
responsibilities involves determining who is going to do which product-related work activities but
also who will provide reports, attend meetings, help with risk identiﬁcation, work with the quality
department, etc. All roles and responsibilities should be deﬁned. They may be documented as part of
the resource management plan, in project job descriptions, and in the management plans for each

T H n E E
Processes and Domains
knowledge area. This item also includes developing a responsibility assignment matrix and a rewards
and recognition system.
Some projects may be organized by phases where detailed planning for the next phase is started as the
previous phase nears completion. In adaptive planning only the ﬁrst part of the project may be fully
planned, while the later portions are planned at a high level and then progressively elaborated when
more is known about the project.
Remember when we said project management seems linear but is more dynamic? The Planning
column has a reminder that planning is the only process group with a set order. However, a planning
process may require an input that won’t be available yet. The risk register, for example, is an input to
several processes leading to the creation of the schedule. Initial risks are uncovered during initiating,
so although the risk register will by no means be complete by the time you’re creating the schedule,
known risks can be factored into your planning. Then, after performing risk management activities,
you’ll have a more complete risk register that you can use to reﬁne your schedule.
Look at the phrase “Go back—iterations.” This is an important concept. Planning is iterative. When
planning a project, the project manager and the team complete each item listed above this point to the
best of their ability. But even a plan-driven project will evolve as the project progresses and earlier
planning work will need to be modiﬁed. For example, it is only after completing the risk management
planning efforts that the WES and the other items can be ﬁnalized. A risk response strategy may be
used to avoid a portion or all of a threat (see the “Risk” chapter). This will require adjusting the WES
for added scope, the network diagram to determine the order of the work, the budget for added cost,
and so on. The project manager might also work with discretionary dependencies to change the
network diagram and thereby decrease some risk (see the "Schedule” chapter).
Notice the term ”procurement strategy and documents” in the Planning column. Note also the
placement of “Finalize procurement strategy and documents” after n:Go back—iterations.” The risk
management process may generate risk response strategies involving contracts ; through iterations the
procurement documents can be created, reﬁned, and ﬁnalized.
The important thing to remember is that planning should lead to a realistic, bought-into, approved,
and formal project management plan that is updated throughout the project to reﬂect approved
changes. Iterations help you create and maintain such a plan.
The distinction between predictive and adaptive approaches is worth thinking about here. The
PMBOK‘E Guide planning processes describes all the traditional activities performed to deﬁne the
total scope, objectives, and course of action for a project. It assumes that with su "icient analysis these
are knowable, and development is then largely the execution of this course of action. Progressive
elaboration and rolling wave planning are effective mechanisms to tune plans to emerging details, and
they act as accepted extensions to generally detailed initial planning.
The process of continually reﬁning estimates and scope deﬁnition is called progressive elaboration.4
Although the project management plan is ﬁnalized in planning, items such as detailed estimates and
project scope and product scope descriptions may be clariﬁed as the work is being done during the
executing and monitoring and controlling processes.
The technique of rolling wave planning5 is a form of progressive elaboration. The earliest parts of the
project are planned in su "icient detail for work to begin. Later phases of project work are planned at
a high level. As the project progresses, and more information impacting the work becomes available,
plans are elaborated in su ”icient detail to accomplish the work.
Adaptive approaches to planning are deliberately more incremental and recommend a process
that iterates to discover and reﬁne scope. Rolling wave planning and progressive elaboration, for
example, can be made to exist within the traditional framework of project management. This approach
makes agile concepts a more central theme rather than a supporting process.
When describing an agile project in a traditional environment it is important to explain that
initial plans will be deliberately light and progressively enriched as early iterations clarify
understandings and provide additional information. It is also useful to know that planning ownership

Processes and Domains
T H n E E

shifts from project manager as primary planner to the team as primary planner. Agile methods
encourage shining much of the planning responsibilities to the team (including business
representation), which takes the form of release and iteration planning and backlog prioritization.
The project management plan and documents (project artifacts) resulting from planning will guide
the execution and control of the project. After the plan is iterated and includes the appropriate detail
for the project life cycle and development approach, the sponsor approves it.
Executing
' With an approved project management plan, the project moves into executing, where the team
completes the work according to the plan. The project managers focus is on leading and managing the
project, including engaging stakeholders, working with the team, following processes, and
communicating according to the plan. For the exam, get your mind around the critical diﬁerence
extensive planning makes. Assume the project was properly planned before work began, unless the
question indicates otherwise.
The purpose of project executing is to complete the project work as deﬁned in the plan, to produce
the project deliverables (the product scope) at agreed quality levels, within the project’s approved
budget and schedule. This achieves the expected business value and agreed-upon beneﬁts.
Team members can be released at any time once their work is approved and accepted and they have
completed activities that pertain to their work. For example, the electricians on a project to build a
house may test their work, get acceptance of their work, document lessons learned, suggest process
improvements, and turn the work over. They are released while other team members doing drywall
are still working. Some team members remain on the project to its end to assist the project manager
in creating the ﬁnal lessons learned, archiving ﬁnal records, and producing the ﬁnal report.
As executing progresses, the project manager may determine that a change is needed. The same could
happen while the project manager is monitoring and controlling the work, or in planning as a result
of rolling wave planning that occurs after the plan has been approved and work has started. Change
requests are evaluated and approved or rejected as part of the Perform Integrated Change Control
process (see the ”Integration Management” chapter).
Monitoring 3: Controlling
' Do the project management process groups occur sequentially? No, they overlap. For example, you
could be using monitoring and controlling processes to control stakeholder identiﬁcation, adherence
to organizational requirements for project planning, or the creation of baselines and project
documents. Defects could be identiﬁed in executing that require work in executing to ﬁx them, as well
as work in monitoring and controlling to decide if the defects require a change to the plan to prevent
future rework and delays. Controlling procurements and the closure of procurements can occur
simultaneously on projects because some sellers will complete their contractual obligations to the
project while others are still producing deliverables. Look again at Rita’s Process ChartTM, and think
about the overall focus of each process group, but also about how the work can overlap at various
points in time.
While the work is being done, work results (or data) are fed into monitoring and controlling to make
sure the project is advancing according to the established baselines. This requires attention to how the
project is progressing, evaluating hard data on how the project is conforming to the plan, and taking
action to address variances that are outside of acceptable limits. The project manager and team are
also assessing how stakeholders are participating, communicating, and feeling about the project and
the work, and addressing uncertainties (or risks) that have been identiﬁed.
The project management plan includes monitoring activities, such as observing, communicating, and
evaluating. It also speciﬁes control activities to be used on the project, along with a plan for how
variations from planned metrics will be addressed.

T H a E E
Processes and Domains
I Outcomes of monitoring and controlling include recommending changes to the way the work is
being done or possibly requesting adjustments to baselines to reﬂect more achievable outcomes.
Change requests are evaluated in Integrated Change Control to determine their impact on the project,
identify the best options for dealing with them, and decide whether they should be approved, rejected,
or deferred.
' Approved changes that require adjustments to baselines and other plan elements require replanning
before the team starts working (in executing). If the project gets so far off the baselines that it requires
an analysis of whether it should continue at all, or if signiﬁcant changes are suggested that are outside
the project charter, it may move back into initiating while that decision is made.
' Make sure you understand the diﬁerence between executing and monitoring and controlling actions ,
because they continually overlap while the work of the project is going on. The focus of executing is
leading peopleJ and managing physical resources and work to accomplish the project as planned. The
focus of monitoring and controlling is ensuring the project is progressing according to plan and
approving necessary changes to the plan to meet the organization’s strategic objectives and deliver the
expected beneﬁts.
Closing
'
The closing effort includes administrative activities such as collecting and ﬁnalizing all the
documentation needed to complete the project, and technical work to conﬁrm that the ﬁnal product
of the project is acceptable. It will also include any work needed to transfer the completed project to
those who will use it and to solicit feedback from the customer about the product and the project.
' While lessons learned should be collected on an ongoing basis on traditional projects, they are
ﬁnalized at closing. On an agile project lessons learned are collected as the project progresses after
every iteration. In both cases they should be put to use right away and after closing be made available
to future projects.
' Work on an agile project is prioritised to undertake the highest business value items ﬁrst, so if the
Closing process group is exercised to prematurely close a project or phase on an agile project there is
a high chance that some useful business value will already have been generated.
I In many real-world situations, projects never seem to o '"icially ﬁnish. Keep in mind that all projects
must complete the required closing activities.

Explanation Notice the use of the word “detailed.” Such a budget is created during project planning.

Explanation The project manager should be assigned during project initiating.

Explanation Even though the measurement was not identiﬁed in planning, the project manager
would still have to investigate the variance and determine if it is important. The project manager is in
project monitoring and controlling.

Explanation This situation does not describe an actual measurement (a monitoring and controlling
activity) but rather a meeting occurring during project executing.

Explanation This is a tricky question, since all of these answers are accurate to some degree. In this
case, the best answer is that you need to use people and process skills along with understanding the
business environment. This answer is the most comprehensive—it includes the tasks described in the
other three answer options. In addition, this is the only answer that mentions the people and process
domains, and to deliver value successfully (in any context) a project manager needs to apply skills from
all three domains.

Explanation The project manager is an integrator. This is a question about your role as an integrator
and communicator.

Explanation The sponsor issues the project charter, so they should help the project manager control
changes to the charter. The primary responsibility lies with the sponsor. Remember that any change to
the project charter should call into question whether the project should continue.

Answer C
Explanation This question is asking for the most important of the choices. Think about what is
involved in integration: project management plan development, project management plan execution;
and integrated change control. Updates and product control are parts of project monitoring and
controlling, while integration includes more than control. Advancing the careers of team members
falls under project executing (the Develop Project Team process). To integrate the project components
into a cohesive whole, communication is key whenever one activity will interface with another or one
team member will interface with another. and when any other form of interfacing will occur.
Answer B
Explanation Integration refers to combining activities J. not team members.
Answer B
Explanation Direct and Manage Project Work is the only correct response.
Answer B
Explanation One way to decide if a change should be approved is to determine whether the work
falls within the project charter. If not, it should be rejected, assigned to a more appropriate project, or
addressed as a project of its own.
Answer C
Explanation The project management plan includes more than just a bar chart and the project
manager’s plan for completing the work. It includes all the management plans for the project.
Answer D
Explanation To narrow down the answer options, this question could be rephrased to ask, "Who
creates the project management plan?” The best answer is that the project management plan is created
by the project manager but requires input from the team.
Answer B
Explanation Determining who will be on the change control board and determining the reporting
structure may have already been done. In any caseJ these choices are not directly impacted by the
number of sponsors who have signed the charter. Having a single project sponsor is not necessary.
This situation implies that there are six areas concerned with this project. In addition to focusing
on the added communications requirements, you should be concerned with competing needs and
requirements impacting your efforts on conﬁguration management.
Answer C
Explanation As the manager of an agile project, you might not need to document the management
plans as separate deliverables; instead, you can rely on agile tools and methods to manage emergent
threats and scope and maximize value delivery. The agile tools for managing risk include a risk
burndown chart, risk-adjusted backlog, and risk-based spikes. These tools can replace a formal risk
management plan, so that is the least likely option.
Answer A
Explanation Notice that this question uses the words “working to clearly describe” and “prevent.”
Taken together, they should tell you the project is in project planning. This eliminates all choices
except Develop Project Management Plan and Plan Quality Management. Coordination and conﬂict
prevention relate to Develop Project Management Plan, and preventing rework is part of Plan
Quality Management.

Answer D
Explanation A WES is created in project planning, but can be used to help manage the project
during project executing. The wording in the question was not “creating a WB S," but "using a WES.” A
project control system is set up during project planning, not during project executing, and therefore
is the exception.
Answer D
Explanation A project manager must manage and integrate all aspects of a project. If all activities
are delegated, chaos ensues, and team members will spend more time jockeying for position than
completing activities.
Answer C
Explanation Crashing and replanning are essentially delaying the problem. Instead, the project
manager should try to prevent it by showing the consequences if the resources are not available. This
is a more effective strategy than saying, ”But you gave those resources to me.”
Answer D
Explanation The other impacts to the project should be evaluated ﬁrst. The change could impact
scope, cost, quality, risk, resources, and / or customer satisfaction. Once these are evaluated, the change
control board, if one exists, can approve or deny the change.
Answer D
Explanation You do not have enough information to consider resource leveling or crashing this
project. As you work on any project, you need to constantly reevaluate the project objectives and how
the project relates to other concurrent projects. Is your project still in line with corporate objectives? If
the other project will impact yours, you need to be proactive and work on options now.
Answer C
Explanation Notice how much information is thrown at you in this question. It is important to
practice reading through questions to discover what is important and what is simply background
information. In this question, the only thing relevant was the corrective action taken. Once you
discover what the primary issue is, look at the choices to ﬁnd out which is best for addressing that
issue. What is the primary issue here? Did you realize the team members note is about a non-critical
path activity? (“Until the project ﬂoat is in jeopardy” means there is ﬂoat; thus, the activity is not
on the critical path.) So, is the issue the non—critical path activity or the documentation? You might
disagree with the logic, but in this case the answer is the documentation. In the real world, problems
often repeat. Without a record of what was done, there is no opportunity to consider the same solution
for future problems. Documentation is critical to projects. Because the change log becomes part of the
historical records database, it is best to ﬁrst record the corrective action taken, then discuss the value
of documentation at the next team meeting, and, ﬁnally, smooth the team member’s issue with the
accounting department.
Answer A
Explanation Straight-line depreciation uses the same amount each time period.
Answer A
Explanation On any project, we want to identify and address changes as low as possible on the cost
of change curve. This is important for agile projects that rely on emergent scope and incremental
development. While agile expects and welcomes changes for the current and future increments in
development, once an increment has been built and approved, rework should be avoided if at all
possible.

F O U R
An agile backlog is subject to continuous changes and tweaks, large and small, by both the pro duct
owner and the team members. While their ultimate goal is to maximize value delivery, they don’t
stop to analyze and measure the impact of each change. Agile tools don’t limit the numb er of changes
needed, in fact they make it possible for changes to be made freely as needed.
The approach to managing changes for plan-driven projects does differ from change-driven
projects. Since there is less uncertainty about the requirements on a plan-driven project, we can better
deﬁne the scope upfront—plan the work, and then work the plan.
Answer C
Explanation Do you remember what to do when there is a change? Evaluate ﬁrst. You wouldn’t take
action before getting approval, so compressing the schedule or cutting scope would happen after
consulting the sponsor andX or advising the client of the impact of the change. You would not go to the
customer before going to your internal management, so advising the client is not the correct thing to
do next. The next step is to discuss options with the sponsor.
Answer B
Explanation Sunk costs are expended costs. The rule is that they should not be considered when
deciding whether to continue with a troubled project.
Answer B
Explanation Complaining about the missed deadline could be done, but it is not proactive. It would
be helpful to get to the root cause of why this department always comes up with such ideas or changes
after the project begins. However, this is not the immediate problem; the change is the immediate
problem, and therefore complaining is not best. The type of project organization described is a matrix
organization. There is not anything inherently wrong with such an organization, nor is there anything
in this particular situation that would require it to be changed. So, changing the way the company is
organized cannot be best. The department’s history indicates that asking if the department has other
changes is something that should deﬁnitely be done, but the proposed change needs more immediate
attention. Looking at impacts of the change begins integrated change control.
Answer D
Explanation Agile projects welcome changes, so you wouldn’t tell the CFO that the backlog is already
prioritized, implying that no changes can be made. You also wouldn’t handle the change yourself since
agile project changes are managed by the pro duct owner and the team. Either of the remaining answer
options might be plausible, but this doesn’t sound like the type of everyday change that the team
would handle on their own without a discussion with the pro duct owner. Also, agile backlo gs typically
don’t have "versions”; they are dynamic documents that are continuously being edited and updated.
So the best answer is to say that you will refer this request to the product owner, who will decide what
to do about it.
Answer D
Explanation Cost-beneﬁt analysis is done earlier in the project to help select between alternatives.
All the other choices are done during the Close Project or Phase process. Therefore, performing cost—
beneﬁt analysis must be the best answer.
Answer B
Explanation A project manager should be looking at where changes are coming from and doing
whatever is necessary to limit the negative effects of change on the project. They need to ﬁnd the root
cause, so future changes may be avoided.

Explanation Tacit knowledge includes emotions, experience, and ability. Sharing this type of

Scope must be clearly deﬁned and formally

formal level with a summarised agreement.
Requirements are elicited from all stakeholders,
not just the person who assigned the project.

Using this tool enables you to clarify identiﬁed
scope as well as ﬁnd additional scope.
A backlog, mindmap, or list, all alternatives to a
traditional WBS, may be utilized on projects
using adaptive approaches. For example, using a

life cycle you are dealing with.
Scope Management Fundamentals
You should understand the following concepts for the exam.
PdUCt SCOPE
Product scope is another way to say “requirements that relate to the product, service,
or result of the project.” It can also be deﬁned as the product deliverables with their associated features and
functions. It answers the question, "What end result is needed?" There may be a separate, preliminary

F I V E
project to determine product scope, or you may deﬁne the requirements as part of your project, depending
on the needs of the project and the organisation.
Let’s look at an example of product scope. On a project to build a new train terminal, the product
scope is ”a new train terminal that meets these technical speciﬁcations.” To determine if the project
successfully achieved the product scope, the resulting product (the new train terminal) is compared to the
product requirements, which were recorded in the requirements documentation and the project scope
statement for the project.
Project SCOPE
The project scope is the work the project team will do to deliver the product of the
project, it encompasses the product scope. In the train terminal example, the project scope will be ”a new
train terminal that meets these technical speciﬁcations,” plus all the work needed to deliver the train
terminal. In other words, project scope includes the planning, coordination, and management activities
(such as meetings and reports) that ensure the product scope is achieved. These efforts become part of the
scope baseline and scope management plan, which are parts of the project management plan. To determine
whether the project scope has been successfully completed, the work accomplished is measured against the
scope baseline.
The SCOPE Management Process
To avoid the risk that you will read the rest of this chapter and
miss an important concept, let’s make this point clear right away: There are a lot of acceptable ways to
manage scope. If you do it differently than described here, you are not necessarily wrong; you may just be
managing scope differently based on the needs of your project. Think of the scope management process as
including the following steps when using a predictive project management approach:

Explanation This question tests your understanding of timeboxing; unexpected developments
like this are exactly why agile approaches rely on timeboxes to bring order to an unpredictable
environment. So the best answer is to ﬁnd out how much of the planned work the team will be able to
complete by the end of the timeb-ox, and return the unﬁnished work to the backlog. In this scenario,
you will want to review the upcoming iterations and releases with the team and customer, but that
won’t necessarily mean postponing them. Ideally, you will be able to keep the development cycles
steady and instead adjust scope. As for the other options, adding a temporary replacement is likely
to just lower productivity as the other team members try to bring the new person up to speed. And
asking the team to work overtime in response to a crisis that you didn’t plan for isn’t consistent with
the agile principles of sustainable development or servant leadership.
Answer B
Explanation After obtaining input from the customer and other stakeholders, the project team is
responsible for developing the scope baseline. Remember that the scope baseline includes the WES,
“TBS dictionary, and project scope statement.
Answer C
Explanation There are many pieces of data in this question that are distractors from the real issue.
Though it is common to have to cut costs and add resources to a project, nothing in the question
should lead you to think these will be required in this situation. Customers do not generally approve
the project scope (what you are going to do to complete their requirements); instead, they approve
the product scope (their requirements). Since requirements are used to measure the completion of the
product of the project, not having complete requirements will make such measurement impossible.
Answer C
Explanation Though it is correct that eﬂbctive scope deﬁnition can lead to a more complete project
scope statement, this cannot be the answer, because it does not deal with control. Scope planning
occurs before the Control Scope process. not after it. Controlling the schedule is not the best way to
control scope, so that is not the best answer. The control processes do not act in isolation. A change to
one will most likely affect the others. Therefore, the need to integrate the Control Scope process with
other control processes is the best answer.
Answer A
Explanation This question tests your understanding of the agile triangle of constraints, which shows
how agile projects balance the competing demands of cost, time, and scope. On plan-driven projects,
scope is ﬁxed while time and cost may vary to ensure that the planned scope is completed. On change-
driven projects, on the other hand, cost and time are ﬁxed while scope may vary. So the correct answer
is that the release version will be ready on time, but it won’t include the least important features
that were originally planned. Skipping some of the usual testing isn’t a good idea. That could impact
quality and customer satisfaction, and therefore reduce the value delivered (agile’s key goal). Adding
temporary help to the team and working overtime aren’t considered good agile practices. An agile
team wouldn’t "crash” their work; they would maintain their usual iterative timeb oxes, focusing on the
user stories at the top of the backlog.
Answer C
Explanation You need to have a product description before you can do product analysis. Analyzing
the level of quality desired is related to the Plan Quality Management process. Determining whether
the quality standards on the project can be met is done in the Manage Quality process. Product
analysis includes gaining a better understanding of the product of the project in order to create the
project scope statement.

Schedule
3 I
This chapter can be difficult for those who do not
realize that a realistic schedule is a project managers
key accountability. Yes, it’s true! If you know the
options for compressing a project schedule, understand
that a project schedule must be realistic before project
executing begins, and can assume you have the
authority and responsibility on the team’s behalf to
make this happen, this chapter should not be difﬁcult
for you.
How do you manage a project schedule? Do you
use software? Software can be extremely helpful and
save time with scheduling, analyzing what—if scenarios,
and performing status reporting functions, but you
cannot rely on it to properly manage a project. To
answer schedule management questions correctly, you
should thoroughly understand the process
of
scheduling a project. Although most project managers
use software to assist with scheduling, you need to
understand the details behind the data. For example,
the exam has often required test takers to know how to
draw network diagrams to answer scheduling questions.
Likewise, knowing the details behind building a story
map will help you get agile questions right.
Make sure you recognize where each schedule
management process falls within the project manage-
ment process and check your knowledge as you work
through this chapter. Particularly if you rely on software
on your projects, you may not have the knowledge and
experience in schedule management that you will need
to pass the exam, such as performing schedule analysis
and creating network diagrams, release maps, and
story maps.

management primarily relies on technical skills. Understanding the Schedule Management process from
the PMBOK‘” Guide and its relationship to the Plan and Manage Schedule task within the Process domain
of the Examination Content Outline (ECO) is fairly straightforward. How you carry out the tasks and
processes depends on methodology. The following chart will help you understand how each part of
schedule management ﬁts into the overall project management process.

s I x
Schedule
Also keep in mind that expert judgment and data analysis techniques, such as alternatives analysis,
may be used in planning the methodology you will use to arrive at a ﬁnal schedule. To plan the schedule,
you might also need to review the project charter or hold meetings that include the project sponsor, team
members, and other stakeholders.
SCtUlB Management Plan
What is the key outcome of this process? A schedule management
plan, which can be formal or informal, is part of the project management plan, and helps make estimating
and schedule development faster by specifying the following:
' Scheduling methodology and software to be used.
' Rules for how estimates should be stated (examples include: hours, days, or weeks, story points, and
whether estimators identify both the eﬁort and duration).
' How a schedule baseline (for measuring against) will be stated, to determine when and where changes
may be needed.
' Performance measures that will be used on the project to identify variances early.
' Acceptable variance threshold(s).
' I—Iow schedule variances will be managed.
' A process for determining whether a variance must be acted upon.
' Identiﬁcation of schedule change control procedures.

Defining and Sequencing Activities
PAGE 133
The Deﬁne Activities and Sequence Activities processes involve taking the work packages created in the
W138 and decomposing them into the activities that are required to produce the work package deliverables
and thus achieve the project objectives. The activities should be at a level small enough to estimate, schedule,
monitor, and control. These activities are then sequenced. Breaking down the project work into the work
packages in the ‘WBS is part of scope management, and the identiﬁcation of activities is part of
schedule management.
Defining ACtltleS
Deﬁning activities is not always done as a separate process. Many project managers
combine this effort with creating a WBS and WBS dictionary; they decompose work packages into the
activities required to produce them, rather than stopping at the work package level.
So, what do you need in order to deﬁne activities? The schedule management plan gives you important
information about the approved methodology for scheduling. The traditional scope baseline (project
scope statement, ms, and WBS dictionary) or the backlog and story cards for agile provide information
about what is included in your project scope. This is the work you wil' now break down into project
activities. You may also refer to organizational process assets, including existing templates, historical
information—such as activity lists from other similar projectsm—and any standards, such as a prescribed
scheduling methodology. Doing this work with the team helps deﬁne activities completely and accurately
and therefore makes the estimates more accurate.

Rolling Wave Planning‘
Have you ever worked on a project that seemed to have too many unknown
components to adequately break down the work and then schedule it? It is often better to not plan the
entire project to the smallest detail in advance, but instead to plan to a higher level and then develop more
detailed plans when the work is to be done. This practice is called rolling wave planning and is a form of
progressive elaboration. Remember that progressive elaboration refers to the process of clarifying and
reﬁning plans as the project progresses. With this method, you plan activities to the detail needed to manage
the work just before you are ready to start that part of the project. This technique is used to varying degrees
on both change-driven and plan- driven projects.
Iterations of rolling wave planning during the project may result in additional activities being added,
and in the further elaboration of other activities. Therefore, rolling wave planning may create the need for
updates to the project management plan, speciﬁcally the schedule, scope, andX or cost baselines. These
changes require integrated change control, beginning with a change re quest.
But remember—the option of rolling wave planning does not eliminate the need to ensure all the
scope that can be known is known before starting work!
Milestones
Deﬁning and sequencing activities also involves determining project milestones. Milestones
are signiﬁcant events within the project schedule. They are not work activities and have no duration. For
example, a completed design, company—required checkpoint, phase gate, or iteration completion could be
a milestone. Initial milestones are documented in the project charter. The project manager can also insert
milestones as checkpoints to help control the project. Ifa milestone in the schedule is reached and any of
the planned work has not been completed, it indicates the project is not progressing as planned. The mile—
stone list is part of the project documents.
SEQUBHClng ACtltlBS
The next process involves taking the activities and sequencing them in the
order in which the work will be performed. The result is a network diagram1 (also referred to as a project
schedule network diagram), which is illustrated in ﬁgure 6.1. There are several exercises designed to help
you learn how to draw and interpret network diagrams later in this chapter.
FIGURE 6.1 Nehwrk diagram
For the exam, know that in its pure form, the network diagram shows just dependencies (logical
relationships). If activity duration estimates and leads and lags are added to the diagram later in the schedule
management process, it can also show the critical path. If plotted out against time (or placed against a
calendar-based scale), the network diagram is a time-scaled schedule network diagram.
Factors that may inﬂuence dependencies in the sequencing of activities include the assumption log,
activity attributes, and milestone list.


Schedule
3 l x
174
More than one dependency can be identiﬁed for the same work. Combinations include mandatory
external, mandatory internal, discretionary external, and discretionary internal.
The project team identiﬁes mandatory and discretionary dependencies; the project manager identiﬁes
external and internal dependencies. (Remember, when we use the term "project manager” in this book,
we’re referring to anyone doing project management activities on the project, which could include not just
the lead project manager but also supporting members of the project management team.)
Dependencies in Hybrid Environments To day’s digital pro ducts have diﬂerent characteristics than
traditional, physical products. Consider how a contractor builds a house. They wouldn’t complete the
interior of the house before they built the roof, would they? Of course not. The roof needs the walls, the
walls need a foundation, and the foundation needs land and permits in place. The dependencies are static,
well understood, and slow to change. Techniques like network diagrams, critical path analysis, and detailed
Gantt charts are valuable and necessary.
In the digital product space, however, there are many more options and possibilities. Good IT
architecture allows services to be swapped out easily and promotes isolating changes. This means there are
far fewer dependencies on digital projects. This, coupled with more requirements, renders much of the
traditional dependency analysis and dependency management redundant, unreliable, and wasteful.
Therefore, many of these techniques are not used in software-heavy digital projects. Instead, project
managers work with product owners to deﬁne what the priorities are, and they work with the teams on how
best to build them. Typically, features can be implemented and evaluated independently of each other.
For example, using a hybrid approach to build an energy trading system for an electrical operator, the
product owner may create an initial sequence of features to be developed. Then they may reorder it
signiﬁcantly once the initial bid and validated screens are complete. The product owner may reorder it
again after the regulatory body responses get integrated. Such schedule upheavals would require extensive
schedule rework with traditional network diagrams and Gantt Charts. By comparison, reordering the
backlog on this hybrid project is much less work.
Leads and Lags A lead may be used to indicate that an activity can start before its predecessor activity is
completed. For example, web page design might be able to start ﬁve days before the database design is
ﬁnished. A lag is waiting time inserted between activities, such as needing to wait three days after pouring
concrete before constructing the frame for a house. When project activities are ﬁrst being sequenced, the
duration of the activities, and required leads and lags, may be uncertain.
Also, when creating complex project schedule network diagrams that include leads and lags as well as
other dependencies, an automated scheduling system that is part of the PMIS can be used. This is especially
helpful on large projects.
Project SCtUlB Network Diagram
Aproject schedule network diagram is an image depicting the
ﬂow of project activities in the logical order in which they will be performed. All activities after Start should
be connected to at least one predecessor activity. All activities on the network diagram before Finish should
be connected to at least one successor activity. In addition to sequencing activities, the network diagram
helps you to plan which activities can be completed in parallel and to see where leads or lags are required.
Of course, the more complex the project, the more likely it is that activities will overlap. When an activity
has two or more activities directly preceding it, this is referred to as path convergence. When an activity has
two or more successor activities directly following it, this is referred to as path divergence. Both path
convergence and path divergence are indicators of greater risk within the imp acted activities.
Rather than just knowing what a network diagram is, you wil' be expected to answer harder, more
sophisticated questions when taking the exam. You need to have worked with network diagrams to
accurately answer such questions. You should know that network diagrams can be used in many ways. For
example, they can be used to:
'I Help justify your time estimate for the project.
' Aid in effectively planning, organizing, and controlling the project.
' Show interdependencies of all activities, and thereby identify riskier activities.

When completed, the Deﬁne Activities
process results in an activity list, which includes all activities required to complete the project, and activity
attributes, or details regarding project activities. At this time, known attributes may be limited to the activity
name and ID number. As the project progresses, additional attributes—such as planned completion date,
leads and lags, and predecessor and successor activities—may be added.
Deﬁne Activities is one of only a few planning processes with an output of change requests speciﬁcally
listed in the PMB OK‘E Guide. Refer back to the discussion of rolling wave planning, and you will see that, as
the project progresses, early planning efforts may need to be iterated, potentially resulting in changes to the
project baselines.
In addition to a network diagram, the Sequence Activities process may result in updates to project
documents such as the activity list, activity attributes, assumption log, and the milestone list. Sequencing
the activities can also reveal new risks, resulting in changes to the risk register.

Estimate Costs processes (see the “Cost” chapter) as well as the Estimate Activity Resources
TRADE”
process (see the "Resources” chapter) all involve estimating. The following are important
points to understand about estimating for the exam:
'
Management plans provide the approach for estimating.
'
The project manager and team may use one or many techniques to estimate project work.
'
Estimating should be based on a “TBS or story card (through planning poker, discussed later in this
chapter) to improve accuracy.
'
Duration, cost, and resource estimates are interrelated, for example, duration and resource estimates
could impact cost estimates.
'
Identiﬁed risks must be considered when estimating the duration, cost, and resource requirements
of project work.
' Estimating duration, cost, and resource requirements may uncover additional, previously
unidentiﬁed risks.
'
Whenever possible, estimating should be done by the person doing the work (or the person most
familiar with the work) to improve accuracy.
' Historical information from past projects (part of organizational process assets) is key to
improving estimates.
'
Estimates are more accurate if smaller-size work components are estimated.
'
A project manager should never just accept constraints from management, but should instead
analyze the needs of the project, develop estimates with input from the team members doing the
work when possible, and reconcile any diﬁ'erences to produce a realistic plan.
'
The project manager may periodically recalculate the estimate to complete (ETC) for the project to
make sure adequate time, funds, and resources, are available for the project.
'
Plans based on estimates should be revised, with approved changes, during completion of the work,
as necessary.
'
There is a process for creating the most accurate estimate possible.
'
Padding estimates is not an acceptable project management practice.
'- The project manager must meet any agreed—upon estimates.

Now let’s think about how estimating works on your projects for a moment. Do your team members
feel like this?
lha vs no idea how
long that will take.
l don’t even know
what you to asking
me to do.
What should l say?
l wlll take my best guess
and double ll!
This response is an example of padding. Do you consider this practice normal or appropriate? It is not.
Many project managers rely on this practice; but padding undermines the professional responsibility of a
project manager to develop a realistic schedule and budget. This is another point that is essential to
understand for the exam.
So what is wrong with padding? A pad is extra time or cost added to an estimate because the estimator
does not have enough information.
In cases where the estimator has many unknowns and the information required to clarify the
unknowns is unavailable, the potential need for additional time or funds should be addressed with
reserves through the risk management process. Through risk management, the uncertainties are turned
into identiﬁable opportunities and threats (risks). They should not remain hidden; instead, estimators need
to identify and openly address uncertainties with the project manager.
What happens if all or many of your estimates are padded? Quite simply, you have a schedule or
budget that no one believes. And if that is the case, why even bother creating a schedule or a budget? In the
real world, we need the schedule and the budget to manage the project against. So we need them to be as
believable and realistic as possible, and we need to adhere to them. To be a successful project manager, you
need to be able to meet the agreed-upon project completion date and budget. It is important to understand
that padding is a sign of p oor project management and that it can damage your reputation and the credibility
of the project management profession as a whole.
You may see questions on the exam that include padding as a solution to an estimating scenario. Just
remember, padding is never a viable way to plan a project or to solve a problem—on the exam or in the
real world.
In a properly managed project, the estimators have a “IRS and may even have helped create it. They
also have a description of each work package (the W133 dictionary) and may have helped create that as well.
They may even have helped create the activity list from the work packages. They know there will be time
and cost reserves on the project that will be determined through actual calculations—not arbitrary
guesses—to address identiﬁed risks or unknowns. With all that information, they should not need to pad
their estimates!
If you allow padding on your projects now, and consider it to be an appropriate practice, please make
sure you reread this section and carefully review the ”Risk” chapter. You need to recognize the difference
between padding and creating reserves, and understand how padding can be detrimental to your project.
The exam questions in this area are designed to identify those who make common project management
errors, such as padding.

Analogous EstimatingE (Top-Down) Applicable to duration, cost, and resource estimating, analogous
estimating uses expert judgment and historical information to predict the future. Management or the
sponsor might use analogous estimating to create the overall project constraint/ estimate given to the
project manager as the project is chartered. The project manager may use analogous estimating at the
project level, using historical data from past, similar projects. (For example, the last ﬁve projects similar to
this one each tool: eight months, so this one should as well.) Analogous estimating can also be used at the
activity level, if the activity has been done on previous projects and if there is substantial historical data to
support the accuracy of such an estimate. (For example, the last two times this activity was completed each
took three days; since we have no other information to go on, we will use three days as the estimate for this
activity and review the estimate when more details become available.) Be aware for the exam that analogous
estimating can be done at various times, and the level of accuracy depends on how closely the project or
activity matches the historical data used.
Parametric Estimating Parametric estimating involves creating a mathematical equation using data from
historical records or other sources, such as industry requirements or standard metrics, to create estimates.
The technique analyzes relationships between historical data and other variables to estimate duration or
cost. It can be applied to some or all the activities within a project. For example, when estimating activity
duration, the estimator may use measures such as time per line of code, time per linear meter, or time per
installation. When used in cost estimating, the measures include cost as one of the variables. So the
measures would be cost per line of code, cost per linear meter, etc.
An estimator might create parametric estimates using the following:
' Regression analysisg (scatter diagram) This diagram tracks two variables to see if they are related 5
the diagram is then used to create a mathematical formula to use in future parametric estimating.

Heuristics” A heuristic means a generally accepted rule, or best practice. An example of a heuristic is the
80 / 20 rule. A schedule heuristic might be, “D esign work is always 15 percent of the total project length.”
The results of parametric estimating can become heuristics.
Three-Point Estimating“L Statistically, there is a very small probability of completing a project on exactly
any one date. As we know, things do not always go according to plan. Therefore, it is often best to state
estimates in a range using three-point estimates. Analyzing what could go right (opportunities) and what
179

Schedule
3 l x
180
could go wrong (threats) can help estimators determine an expected range for each activity. By analyzing
this range of time or cost estimates, the project manager can better understand the potential variation of the
activity estimates. With the three-point technique, estimators give an optimistic (O), pessimistic (P), and
most likely (M) estimate for each activity. Three—point estimating allows more consideration of both the
uncertainty of estimating and the risks associated with the activities being estimated. A wide range between
the optimistic and pessimistic estimates can indicate uncertainty—and therefore risk —associated with
the activity.
Ultimately, three-point estimates can be used to calculate a risk-based expected duration estimate for
an activity by taking either a simple average or a weighted average of three estirnates. See the following
information and formulas.
Triangular Distribution (Simple Average) A simple average of the three-point estimates can be calcu-
lated using the formula (P + O + M) / 3. The use of simple averaging gives equal weight to each of the three-
point estimates when calculating the expected activity duration or cost. Using this formula, the risks (P and
O estimates) are considered equally along with the most likely (M) estimate.
Beta Distribution (Weighted Average)11 The use of b eta distribution (a weighted average) gives stronger
consideration to the most likely estimate. Derived from the program evaluation and review technique
(PERT),13 this technique uses a formula to create a weighted average for the work to be done: (P + 4M +
O)/6. Since the most likely estimate is multiplied by 4, it weights the average toward that estimate. This
method of estimating leverages the beneﬁts of risk management in reducing the uncertainty of estimates.
When a good risk management process is followed, the most likely estimates are more accurate because
risk response plans have been developed to deal with identiﬁed opportunities and threats that have been
factored into the pessimistic and optimistic estimates.
For the exam, you should know the formulas for both triangular and beta distribution and
understand that if you are asked to calculate the activity duration or cost, you will need to read
the situation carefully to determine which formula to use. Terms like "simple” or “straight” refer
to triangular distribution, “weighted” refers to beta distribution. Knowing this will help you choose the
correct formula.
You may be asked to perform calculations using the formulas, or to analyze information to determine
which calculation is best for the situation presented. If the scenario indicates that you don’t have a lot of
experience or historical information, you would use triangular distribution, which provides a straight
average. Beta distribution is used when there are historical data or samples to work with. The exercises that
follow can help you prepare for three-point estimating questions on the exam. But ﬁrst, review the formulas,
shown again in ﬁgure 6.5.
You must memorize these formulas and remember that they can be used for both time and
cost estimates.

On the exam, if you do not select the right formula for a question that requires a calculation of expected
activity duration, you could end up choosing the wrong answer. These exercises are provided for
understanding and do not necessarily represent the complexity of questions on the exam. Most of the
questions on the exam relating to three-point estimating are relatively simple and may require assessment,
but net calculations.
Activity standard deviation” is the possible range fer the estimate. For example, an activity estimate
of 30 hours that has a standard deviation of +/— 2 is expected to take between 28 hours and 32 hours. The
formula for beta activity standard deviation is (P — O) / 6. Calculation using these formula is not a focus of
the exam, but understanding and interpreting standard deviation in a situational question is important.
Although there is a standard deviation formula for triangular distribution, it’s complicated and is
unlikely to be on the exam so we are not showing it here. What you need to remember for the exam is that
the greater the standard deviation, the greater the risk.
To establish a range for an individual activity estimate using weighted (beta) averaging, you need to
know the beta expected activity duration (EAD) and the beta activity standard deviation (SD). You
calculate the range using beta BAD +f— SD. The start of the range is beta BAD — SD, and the end of the
range is beta BAD + SD. Review the following table to see how the information is presented. Keep in mind
that the exam scenario may include information for you to do the same evaluation with triangular
distribution.

The formulas we’ve been discussing relate to activities, rather than the overall project. The exam
concentrates on using three-point estimating to ﬁnd ranges for activity duration and cost estimates. You can
also use this information to calculate the overall project estimate and the project standard deviation to help
manage a project successfully. Consider how these ranges might affect the estimate of the overall project
duration and cost, and use this knowledge to effectively address variations on your project.
For the exam, you should be able to do simple calculations using the formulas, understand that
estimates of time (or cost) should be in a range, and interpret the information to answer situational
questions. You may also see beta total project duration (for example, the project duration is 35 months plus
or minus 3 months) used in questions that require you to evaluate the situation, rather than complete a
calculation, to answer the questions correctly. Remember that, just like with an activity. the greater the
range for the project as a whole, the greater the risk.
Why do project managers need to understand expected durations, range estimates, and standard
deviations? The main purpose is to use these concepts to better monitor and control projects. These
calculations help you know the potential variances on your project and determine appropriate courses
of action.
You can use estimated ranges and standard deviation to assess risk. Looking back at the table presenting
beta standard deviation in this section, which activity has the most risk? The answer is Activity B. It has the
widest range and the highest standard deviation, and is therefore likely to have the greatest risk. These

s I x
Schedule
calculations are based on the pessimistic, optimistic, and most likely estimates for an activity. The further
away from the mean these estimates are, the more that could go right or wrong and alfect the activity.
Therefore, you can assess and compare the risk of various activities by looking at activity ranges and
standard deviations.
Don’t forget that these concepts also apply to cost. Let’s say you have estimated that a portion of your
project will cost $1 million with a standard deviation of $200,000. You need to decide whether to use a
ﬁxed-price contract to outsource that piece of the project work. The standard deviation indicates there is a
40 percent range in the cost estimate for the work. Therefore, you would not likely choose a ﬁxed-price
contract, since this large standard deviation suggests there is not a ﬁrm deﬁnition of the scope of the work
to be done. (See the "Procurement” chapter for information about types of contracts.)
Bottom—Up Estimating” This technique involves creating detailed estimates for each part of an activity
(if available) or work package (if activities are not defined). Doing this type of estimating well requires an
accurate WBS. The estimates are then rolled up into control accounts and ﬁnally into an overall
project estimate.
Make sure you have a general understanding of these estimating concepts. If you are still struggling
with this topic, review this section again.
Afﬁnity Estimating A ”inity estimating is an adaptive technique that involves grouping items into similar
categories or collections—i.e., “a "'inities.” Teams use this technique for many purposes, but one of the most
important is to make sure a story point unit remains consistent for all estimates over the duration of the
project. Aiﬁnity estimating is a form of triangulation—it offers a comparative view of the estimates and
provides a reality check. Placing user stories into size categories makes it easier to see whether stories with
similar estimates are, in fact, comparable in size. This helps ensure you have not gradually altered the
measurement of a story point during the estimating process.
T—shirt SizingMi T—shirt sizing is a high-level estimating approach that is used to do the initial estimates of
the product features and user stories during the early stages of an adaptive project. At that point in the
project, the team is not trying to generate detailed estimates; they are aiming to do just enough estimating
to map out the overall eﬁort they expect will be involved in the project and get the work started. This is
referred to as coarse—grained estimating, since these early estimates will be progressively reﬁned as the
project continues.
To see how this works, let’s look at an example project. For an online movie service, the team has
identiﬁed six pro duct features:
' Rate movies
'
Sell movies
'
Browse movies
'
Review movies
I Rent movies
'
Sort movies by year
The next step is to roughly size the six features for the movie service, so you can assess the relative
effort involved in developing each one. Since you haven’t done any work on the project yet, you’ll have to
make these estimates based on your experience with similar work items in the past. To reﬂect the uncertainty
involved in those estimates, the estimating unit will be T—shirt sizes, ranging from Extra Small (ES) to
Extra-Extra-Large (XXL). You won’t try to estimate the absolute size of each category, or even how much
bigger or smaller each size is compared to the other sizes. All we will know is that Extra Small is smaller than
Small, which is smaller than Medium, and so on.

The results of our sizing eﬁort are shown in ﬁgure 6.6. As you can see, we’ve decided that:

Planning Peker” One cemmen way agile teams ceme up with the estimates fer their user steries is a
cellaberative game called planning peker. Planning peker is a fast, e T- cient pre cess that is iterative, adaptive,
cellaberative, and anenymeus eneugh te minimize mest bias. Planning peker uses playing cards that shew
numbers based en a speciﬁc sequence. Each participant receives a set ef these cards, as shewn belew. The

that story, without showing it yet. When everyone is ready, the facilitator counts to three, and everyone lays
down their cards at the same time, showing their estimates of the effort required to develop that user story.
If the range of played cards is small and there is a rough consensus on the estimate, the largest estimate
is selected. After that, the team will move on to the next story to keep the game moving quickly. However,
if there is a large discrepancy in the cards played, the team discusses the reasoning behind the diﬁerences in
their estimates. Then, everyone picks up their card and estimates again, taking the new information into
account.
The goal of planning poker is not to create precise estimates. Instead, it aims to help the team quickly
and e ”iciently reach consensus on reasonable estimates so the project can keep moving forward.
Data AllﬂlYSlS
Estimate Activity Durations uses two forms of data analysis , alternatives analysis and
reserve analysis.
Alternatives Analysis When activity estimates are not acceptable within the constraints of the project,
alternatives analysis is used to look more closely at the variables that impact the estimates. For example,
comparing options such as outsourcing work versus completing it internally to meet a schedule constraint,
or purchasing testing software to decrease the time of manually testing components. Alternatives analysis
involves evaluating the impact of each option on project constraints, including ﬁnancial investment versus
time saved and level of risk. This process will result in the determination of the best approach to complete
project work within the constraints.
Reserve Analysis Now let’s connect the topics of estimating and risk management. Estimating helps to
identify more risks. Risk management reduces the uncertainty in time and cost estimates. This is
accomplished by evaluating and planning for signiﬁcant opportunities and threats, including how they will
be dealt with if they occur. Risk management saves the project time and money!
Project managers have a professional responsibility to establish a reserve to accommodate the risks
that remain after the risk management planning processes are completed. Often in the risk management
process, an initial reserve is estimated, the Plan Risk Responses process is performed to reduce the risk, and
then a revised reserve is created. This is another example of the iterative nature of project planning.
As described in the “Risk” chapter, two types of reserves can be added to the project schedule:
contingency reserves and management Ii'eservr.ts.13
Contingency reserves for schedule are allocated for the identiﬁed risks remaining after the Plan Risk
Responses process (known unknowns). These reserves are included in the project schedule baseline.
Signiﬁcant risks to critical path activities may be managed by allocating a speciﬁc amount of schedule
reserve. The amount of this schedule reserve is based on the impact of identiﬁed risks on the activity as well
as the contingency plans to deal with it.
The expected values of each contingency plan are added together to create a schedule contingency
reserve. The project manager employs the contingency plan and uses the contingency reserve when
identiﬁed risks occur. This keeps the project within the schedule baseline. (See the “Risk” chapter for a
more detailed discussion of reserves.)
Management reserves are additional funds and time to cover unforeseen risks that could impact the
project’s ability to meet the schedule. (These risks are referred to as unknown unknowns.) Management
reserves are not part of the schedule baseline. These reserves may not be applied at the project managers
discretion, but rather require approval of a formal change request. The "Risk” chapter explains how these
reserves are calculated.
For the exam, you should understand the major difference between the practice of creating reserves
and the practice of padding. In creating reserves, the project manager has the information necessary to
reliably calculate additional time or funds needed for the project, whereas with padding, team members
arbitrarily determine how much of a pad they want to attach to their estimates.

s I x
Schedule
Decision-Making
Involving team members in estimating can be beneﬁcial on many levels. These
doing the work are most likely to have a good understanding of the time required to complete the eﬁort.
Additionally, including team members in the estimating process increases their buy-in to the
resulting schedule.
Voting is a method that can be used during decision-making— giving every participant the opportunity
to weigh in on a decision regarding an activity estimate or amount of reserve needed. 0n plan-driven
projects, voting may result in a decision based on plurality, majority, or unanimity. A voting technique
commonly used on change-driven projects is “ﬁst of ﬁve,” also called “ﬁst to ﬁve.” In this variation, team
members are asked to physically show their level of support for a decision. A closed ﬁst indicates a zero (no
support) and an open ﬁst indicates ﬁve (full support). Team members who are not supportive, and showed
two or fewer ﬁngers in the vote, are allowed to share why they are not in support of the option. Voting is
repeated until everyone in the group indicates their support by showing at least three ﬁngers.
OlllplllS 0f SCtUlB Estimating When the Estimate Activity Durations process is completed, you
will, of course, have estimates, including reserves. But remember that you may also update or make changes
to the project documents, including activity attributes, assumption log, and lessons learned register as a
result of this process. Outputs of this process on adaptive projects include an updated, prioritized backlog
of user stories, coarse-grained estimates of user stories, a release goal focused on customer value, and a
target date for release.
Another output of this process is the basis of estimates. The basis of estimates is an explanation of how
the estimates were derived, what assumptions and constraints were included, and what risks were taken
into consideration in the estimation process. Basis of estimates also includes the conﬁdence level of the
estimators, expressed as a range, such as plus or minus 20 percent within which the actual project results are
expected to fall.
Preparing the Schedule
PAGE 205
After network diagram and activity duration estimates are completed, it is time to create a schedule mo del.lg
This can be done using a variety of software tools within a project management information system (PMIS).
The schedule model includes all the project data that will be used to calculate the schedule, such as the
activities, duration estimates, dependencies, and leads and lags. The project schedule is the output of the
schedule model, and it consolidates all the schedule data. Representations of the schedule include bar
charts and milestone charts. The approved project schedule is the baseline (a version of the schedule model
that can only be changed with change control procedures), and is part of the project management plan.
The schedule is calendar-based, approved, and realistic as it includes all the activities needed to
complete the work of the project, as well as contingency reserves to manage risk events. Consider what is
involved in creating a schedule. Let’s start at the beginning. What do you need before you can develop a
schedule for your project? To develop a schedule, you need to have:
' Historical records of previous, similar projects including lessons learned
' Components of the project management plan needed to develop a realistic schedule (schedule
management plan and scope baseline)
' Deﬁned activities (activity list and attributes)
' Milestone list
' Assumption log
' The order in which the work will be done (network diagram)
' Basis of estimates
' An estimate of the duration of each activity (activity duration estimates)
' An estimate of the resources needed (resource requirements)

The next few exercises should help you better understand these concepts. As you do the exercises,
think about how knowing ﬂoat helps you manage your projects.
Be prepared for diiferent types of exam questions. Some questions may be substantially similar to the
following exercises, and others may be more situational and wordy. Not all questions will require you to
draw a network diagram.
5.4 EXBI'ClSB Test yourself. In your Exercise Notebook, draw a network diagram based on the
following information, and then answer questions 1-7 below.
You are the project manager for a new project and have ﬁgured out the following dependencies:
' Activity 1 can start immediately and has an estimated duration of 3 weeks.
'- Activity 2 can start after activity 1 is completed and has an estimated duration of 3 weeks.
' Activity 3 can start after activity 1 is completed and has an estimated duration of 6 weeks.
' Activity 4 can start after activity 2 is completed and has an estimated duration of 8 weeks.
' Activity 5 can start after activity 4 is completed and after activity 3 is completed. This activity
takes 4 weeks.
What is the duration of the critical path?
What is the ﬂoat of activity 3?
What is the ﬂoat of activity 2.?
What is the ﬂoat of the path with the longest ﬂoat?
E n d “ ? ? ?
The resource working on activity 3 is replaced with another resource who is less experienced.
The activity will now take 10 weeks. How will this affect the project?

Explanation Did you notice how di icult this question was to read? Such wording is intentional—to
prepare you for interpreting questions on the real exam. Looking at this situation, you see there are
three paths through the network, as shown in the following table. If the duration of activity B changes
from 25 to 37, the activity will take 12 hours longer. As the activity is only on the third path, it will
only change the duration of that path from 55 to 55 + 12, or 67 hours. Since the duration of the critical
path is 107 hours, the delay with activity B will have no impact on the project timeline or the current
critical path.

Explanation Sequencing the activities is the same thing as creating a network diagram, so that has
already been done. The Validate Scope process is done during project monitoring and controlling, not
during project planning. Since a schedule is an input to risk management, risk management comes after
the creation of a preliminary schedule, and so that is not the next thing to do. Creating the preliminary
schedule is next.
32.. Answer D
Explanation Determining dependencies and analogously estimating the schedule should have
already been completed. The situation described is within the Develop Schedule process of schedule
management. Control Schedule is the next schedule management process after Develop Schedule, but
the Develop Schedule process is not yet ﬁnished. Final approval of the schedule by the stakeholders is
needed before one has a project schedule.

Explanation The key to this question is the phrase "constant number of resources used each month.”
Only leveling has such an effect on the schedule.

Answer D
Explanation Out of these answers, the only;r option for communicating project progress would be the
cumulative flow diagram. This diagram will show your stakeholders the product features complete, in
progress, and remaining, as well as any changes in total scope. This makes it a powerful tool for tracking
and forecasting the delivery of value. There is no such thing as a "velocity burndown matrix," and the
other two options don’t track progress over time.
Answer B
Explanation Analogous estimating can be used when you have done similar work previously. Monte
Carlo analysis is a schedule development technique. Parametric estimating includes the use of historyr
and productivity rates for the work, which would not be available if you had not done the activity
before. Three-point estimating is the best method to use in this case because it allows you to estimate
in a range—optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely.

Explanation Quality metrics are an output of the Plan Quality Management process. They are an
input to the Manage Quality pro cess, the process in which quality audits take place.

Explanation The rule of seven applies here. Ifyou have seven data points in a row on the same side of
the mean1 statistically the mean has shifted, calling for action to correct the problem.
14-. Answer A
Explanation One of the ways that a project manager can help an agile team improve quality is to
promptly investigate and try to quickly resolve any impediments raised in the team’s daily stand-up.
A project manager shouldn’t assign improvement initiatives to an agile team, since they develop
that collectively as part of their ”inspect and adapt” continuous improvement process. The team’s
iteration retrospectives should be run by the team and any action items should he arrived at through
a collaborative process. Agile teams aim to minimize their cycle time, which is why an overly long
cycle time may indicate a problem. So if their cycle time falls, it isn’t likely to indicate a problem; they
are probably just working more e "iciently. While it may be tempting to leave the team alone on the
grounds that agile teams should learn to be self-organising, ignoring your team isn’t consistent with
servant leadership. A proactive servant leader will be interacting with the team members regularly to
see if they need any support and to catch any emerging issues and impediments.

Explanation The halo eifect refers to the tendency to rate team members high or low on all factors
due to the impression of a high or low rating on one speciﬁc factor. It can result in a decision to move
people into a diﬁerent technical ﬁeld because they are good in their current technical ﬁeld. However,
just because a person is good in one technical ﬁeld does not mean they will also be good in another
technical ﬁeld.

Explanation Delaying the issue is called withdrawal.

Explanation: While any of these options might sound plausible, we have to pick the best answer
based on the information provided. The scenario says this project is using a lean approach, which
focuses on eliminating waste and delivering value as quickly as possible. This means the team should
be focused on reducing lead time—the time it takes to deploy a new feature after it’s been identiﬁed.
There isn’t enough information to identify any of the other options as a higher priority.

Answer D
Explanation It is the sponsor’s role to prevent unnecessary changes and to set priorities among
projects. The situation described in this question implies that such work is not being done. The project
manager must therefore go to the root of the problem: the sponsor.
Answer A
Explanation Although it would seem to be a good idea to improve schedule performance; the SP1 is
good. The schedule has been approved as it is. It would be better for the project manager to spend more
time controlling the project to make sure it ﬁnishes according to plan.
This also means there is nothing wrong with the schedule performance of the project that would
require an extension. Gaining formal acceptance from the customer will need to be done, but will not
affect the team member’s dissatisfaction.
The only real problem presented in this situation is that the team member is complaining. The
team member was involved in creating and approving the project management plan, which included
details about his own involvement in the project. Because the responsibility assignment matrix has not
changed, the team member has not even been assigned different duties since the project began. The
project manager should investigate and ﬁnd out if the reward system is ineEective.
Answer B
Explanation The correct answer is being able to understand and inﬂuence the emotions of others;
this is a key component of emotional intelligence. Change-driven approaches such as agile emphasise
collective decision making , rather than relying on the servant leader to make decisions independently.
The servant leader should allow most conﬂicts between team members to be resolved by those directly
involved unless they start to escalate. Balancing the diverse requirements of the project stakeholders
would be primarily the responsibility of the pro duct owner or value management team, not the project
manager.
Answer C
Explanation Here is a situation in which all four choices could be done, but there is one best answer.
Asking the sponsor if the information could be sent in a report does not solve the root cause of the
problem described. Informing the team member of the value of communication in meetings merely
dismisses the concerns of the team member. A team-building exercise would take planning, so it could
not be done right away. Remember, the sponsor might be attending the next meeting, and at least one
team member might not attend because of past problems. The best thing to do would be to set up new
ground rules governing team behavior and then plan a team-building exercise.
Answer A
Explanation The best thing to do is to look at the two terms used here (project performance appraisals
and team performance assessments) , and review in your mind what each means before looking at the
choices. Team performance assessments evaluate the project team’s effectiveness as a whole. Project
performance appraisals deal with how each team member is performing on the project.
Answer B
Explanation Both parties are giving up something. This is a compromise.
Answer C
Explanation The resource histogram shows the resources used per time period, but it would provide
limited beneﬁt in this situation. The responsibility assignment matrix cross-references resources with
the activities or work packages they are to accomplish to help give clarity to the team members on
their assignments, but it does not show when they will be required to do their work. The resource
management plan, which describes when resources will be brought onto and taken off the project as
well as how team members should communicate with the project manager, would provide the most
beneﬁt for this project.

Communications
T E
How often do you skip sending a message thinking
you’ll get to it later? Or maybe you’ve sent a message
but summarized the communication instead of
including all the details. If someone needs more data,
they’ll ask for it, right? Or have you ever received a
message and reviewed it quickly thinking you under—
stood the main point? Project communications
can
sometimes feel like overkill, especially when communi-
cation is constantly going on throughout any given day.
Many beginning project managers rely on a mix of these
casual exchanges and some type of formal reporting as
a way to manage all necessary communication needs.
But this almost always leads to missed information,
which ultimately results in a negative impact on
the project.
It’s no surprise that project managers typically
identify communication—related issues as the #1
problem they experience most frequently on projects.
Add to that the list of factors that impact
communications. Here are just a few examples:

continuously monitored throughout the life of a project. Managing communications may include assessing
the communication needs of stakeholders and determining what methods will be best for the project.
Communication channels will also need to be reviewed, along with the frequency and level of detail of all
project communications. Most importantly, project managers need to ensure effective communications so
they are understood and appropriate feedback loops are completed.

Communications

Eifective project managers create communications management plans that go beyond formal and
traditional reporting structures. They also continually reassess stakeholder communication needs,
communicating face—to—face whenever possible to establish good ongoing relationships. These positive
working relationships ease the effectiveness of each opportunity to exchange information and move project
goals forward. Effective project managers also frequently revisit communications strategies to limit the
potential for communication problems. To pass the exam, you should have this type of mindset about
communicating on projects.

Task 2: Manage Communications
These tables illustrate that the communications management process from the PMB OK‘E’ Guide can be
most closely mapped to the Examination Content Outline (ECO) task 2, Manage Communications.
However, the management of res ources and stakeholders closely align with tasks related to communications
management. For examples related to stakeholders and resources, see domain I (People) tasks 4, 5, 9, and
13 and domain II (Process) tasks 4, 12, and 16. The following domain I tasks all require a project manager
to have an understanding of communication models and blockers along with careful attention to
communication types, technology, and methods: manage conﬂict (task 1), lead and build a team (tasks 2
and 6), support team performance (task 3), build shared understanding (task 10), and engage and support
virtual teams (task 11). In fact, communications management is involved in almost everything you do on a
project.
Although this chapter is not particularly diﬂicult, it is one you should take seriously. Be sure to ﬁnd
your gaps regarding project communications, and be aware that communications questions are frequently
combined with other topics. For example, a WES, story backlog, and release maps are used as
communications tools although they are primarily scope tools (see the "Scope” chapter). Another example
is risk response strategies, which should be communicated to stakeholders (see the “Risk” chapter). You
may also see questions linking communications management to stakeholder engagement.
To prepare for the exam, it’s important to solidify your knowledge and understanding of the basics
and overall foundation of project communications.
The Foundation of Communications
PAGE 350
To eﬁectively conduct and facilitate project communications, you need to have a good understanding of
the foundation and basics of communications. Tnis means you must understand communications tech-
nology, methods, and models. You must also take into account the performing organizations established
processes and procedures for communicating about projects, its historical records and lessons learned from
previous projects, and other stored information (organizational process assets). In addition, you must
consider the performing organisation’s environment and approved communication systems, including its
culture and expectations (enterprise environmental factors). Let’s ﬁrst look at a model of how the ﬂow of
communications should work on projects.

Explanation Communication blockers can range from a lack of cultural sensitivity to a failure to
provide concise messages. Blockers cause miscommunication and can lead to disagreement and
confusion. The major result of communication blockers and miscommunication as a whole is conﬂict.

Explanation The question states that all stakeholders received the information, so the issue is not
that this stakeholder did not receive it. The problem presented here illustrates that there is something
missing in the communications management plan. The best answer is to review the communications
management plan in order to prevent future problems and to ﬁnd any instances of similar problems.

Explanation Expected monetary value is calculated by EMV = probability 3: impact. We need to
calculate both positive and negative values and then add them:
0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000
0.4 x ($100,000) = ($40,000)
Expected monetary value = $60,000 — $40,000 = $20,000 proﬁt

Explanation A mean of 28 days is not a range estimate, and so must be eliminated as a possible answer.
When you look at the ranges of each of the other choices, you will see that 30 days, plus or minus 5
days = a range of 10 days. The range of 22 to 30 days = a range of 3 days. An optimistic estimate of 26
days, most likely estimate of 30 days, and pessimistic estimate of 33 days represents a range of 7 days.
The estimate with the smallest range is the least risky, and is therefore the correct choice. Did you
realize the words "+/— 3 sigma” are extraneous? Practice reading questions that are wordy and have
extraneous data.

Explanation Expected monetary value is calculated by multiplying the prob ability times the impact.
In this case, EMV = 0.9 X $10,000 = $9,000.

Explanation Once signed, a contract is binding to both sides. Contracts typically state that either side
can cheese to terminate the agreement by negotiating a settlement based on work already performed.
Generally. the inability to perform or get ﬁnancing, or one party’s belief that the contract is null and
void do es not change the fact that the contract is binding. If, however, both sides agree to terminate the
contract, the contract can move into closure. An illegal contract is net enforceable.

Explanation Of these options, the only global change that would make a plan-driven standard
contract “more agile” would be to increase the customer’s involvement in prioritizing and reviewing
the deliverables. The time allowance for meetings and planning activities shouldn’t be reduced until
you have more experience with the new approach—if anything, an agile approach will require more
planning and collaboration, not less. (Although less planning will be done upfront, more planning
will be needed while the work is in progress.) Since agile projects rely on timebexes with ﬁxed end
dates, there shouldn’t be any need to adjust the iterative delivery deadlines. Change-driven projects
in an uncertain environment evolve the requirements as the work proceeds; they don’t rely on
detailed speciﬁcation.

Explanation Incentives are meant to bring the objectives of the seller in line with those of the buyer;
so both are working toward the same objective.

Explanation There are always good ideas (changes) that can add beneﬁt to the project, regardless
of the contract type. Although detailed speciﬁcations may reduce the need for changes, they do not
eliminate all the causes. Contracts should include procedures to accommodate changes.

Answer A
Explanation Halting all payments would be a breach of contract on the buyer’s part. Voiding the
contract and beginning legal action is too severe and cannot be done unilaterally. Changing the
contract to require more frequent audits does not solve the problem presented. A choice that said,
“Halt payments on the disputed amount” would probably be the best answer, but it is not offered. The
best choice available is to continue to make the payments while working to resolve the issue.
. Answer B
Explanation As a project manager, you want to develop a good relationship during negotiations
that will last throughout the project. Negotiations are not about getting the most from the other side
(win-lose), as such actions will not create a good relationship. That doesn’t mean, however, the buyer
sacriﬁces what is best for the organization.
. Answer D
Explanation The seller can try to negotiate changes or simply continue the original contract and
refuse requests to complete additional work, but the seller cannot unilaterally decide to start over with
a new contract. Both parties have to agree to this option through negotiations.
Answer A
Explanation Answering sellers’ questions, advertising, and proposal evaluation occur during the
Conduct Procurements process. Make-or-buy decisions are made earlier—in the Plan Procurement
Management process.
Answer D
Explanation Risk analysis is done before the Conduct Procurements process begins, as procurement
is a risk mitigation and transference tool. Selecting a contract type is part of Plan Procurement
Management. Market research is also performed in the Plan Procurement Management process,
to enable selection of the appropriate sellers for the needs of the project. During the Conduct
Procurements process, the project manager answers questions submitted by prospective sellers.
Answer B
Explanation Cutting scope decreases proﬁts on this type of contract, so that would not be a way for
the seller to generate extra proﬁts. CPFF contracts general'y do not limit fee increases. The fee in a
CPFF contract is usually paid out on a continuous basis during the life of the project. One of the ways
to change the proﬁt in a cost plus ﬁxed fee contract is to invoice for items not chargeable to the project.
This would not be ethical by the seller but does not mean that a seller may not try it. Therefore, all
invoiced costs should be audited.
Answer B
Explanation In a graduated ﬁxed—price contract. the hourly rate that the supplier receives depends on
how quickly they complete the work. If the supplier delivers early, they get paid for fewer hours but at
a higher rate. If they deliver on time, they get paid for the hours worked at their standard rate. Ifthey
deliver late, they get paid for more hours; but at a lower rate. The other answer options don’t describe
this type of contract.
Answer A
Explanation The fee or proﬁt is known to the seller, but this question is asked from the buyer’s
perspective. The buyer does not know what proﬁt the seller included in the response to the bid
document and. therefore. will not know the proﬁt in the ﬁxed—price contract.

Explanation This question is written from the perspective of the seller. The contract could be
wrong or the customer could be wrong, but this should have been discovered earlier if proper project
management was followed. A seller cannot issue a change order (although they could request one).
Did you select calling a meeting of the team? If so, remember that proper project management does
not mean making every decision with all the team members. The best choice involves reviewing the
requirements documentation and meeting with the appropriate team member. If such a problem
has arisen, it could mean something was wrong in the ‘WBS dictionary or in how the team member
completed the work.

Explanation Identifying all the stakeholders , determining their needs , and managing their
expectations are all parts of go ed stakeholder management. Giving stakeholders added value (including
extras not documented in the requirements) is known as gold plating. This is not effective stakeholder
or quality management.

## Answer A


Explanation It is the project managers responsibility to ensure that compliance requirements are
met. In this scenario, that will mean ﬁnding the appropriate person to complete the form and ensure
that it is submitted on time. The person who completes this form must have the necessary expertise,
and based on the information provided, we can’t tell who that would be. We don’t know whether the
project manager, business analyst, or PMO have enough knowledge of the security requirements to
complete the form. We can only say that the project manager needs to determine who is best qualiﬁed
to ﬁll out the form, and ensure that it is ﬁlled out accurately and submitted on time

Explanation High—level constraints are identiﬁed in the project charter, which is created during
project initiating.

Explanation As the project life cycle progresses, more information becomes available, allowing the
team to manage the project to a more detailed level.

Explanation Did you get lost looking at all the numbers presented in this question? Notice that there
are no calculations required, simply an understanding of what the problem is. This question describes
schedule management, which is a responsibility of the project manager.

Explanation Quality audits are a necessary part of the Manage Quality process. They help you assess
whether the processes are being followed correctly on the project.

Explanation The deﬁned level of acceptable spillage would be documented in the quality management
plan. The quality policy and control charts are components of a quality management plan. Quality
audit documentation is created in Manage Quality. while the work of the project is being done. The
amount of acceptable spillage would have been determined in the Plan Quality Management process.

Answer C
Explanation Control charts show whether measurements of project deliverables are within
speciﬁcation limits, and are used in the Central Quality process. The seller cannot generally control or
review the customer’s quality process. Checking the accuracy of costs submitted by the team is more
representative of a cast audit than a quality audit, so that option cannot be the best choice. Manage
Quality, of which an audit is part, focuses on processes, procedures, and standards. One purpose of a
quality audit is to identify inefﬁcient and ineffective policies.
Answer A
Explanation If your team’s cycle time starts to go up, that is a cause for concern, not celebration.
While a root-cause analysis might well be the best option, an agile retrospective is a collaborative
process, so it wouldn’t be appropriate to just tell the team what to do. So the best approach is to start
by opening the topic for discussion and brainstorming. You wouldn’t want to congratulate the team or
ask them to build on this trend, since it isn’t a positive development.
Answer C
Explanation Assuring management that it was determined in planning that the project would meet
quality standards is not productive, since it does not solve the problem. An analogous estimate looks
at the past history of other projects. This would not be appropriate to determine how the current
project is going. The quality management plan does not provide results. The quality team could help to
determine whether the team is following the correct process to satisfy the relevant quality standards.
Answer C
Explanation Agile teams aim to minimize their work in progress for several reasons, one of which is
to improve the delivery of value, since work in progress represents money that has been invested but
isn’t producing any return yet. The other answer options don’t make sense since they assume that the
sponsor’s concerns are warranted. A long cycle time, lack of prompt feedback, and variable velocity
could certainly lead to problems. Still, if the team isn’t working efﬁciently (due to these or other
issues), it would tend to increase their work in progress, not decrease it.
Answer D
Explanation Focus groups are a tool of the Collect Requirements process, and would not be useful in
Control Quality. The other choices are all tools and techniques of the Control Quality process.
Answer C
Explanation Although quality problems may lead to quality improvement efforts, they are not a
prerequisite for quality improvement. Quality improvement is a result of Manage Quality and Control
Quality, not an input. Rework (or requested defect repair) can be an output of Control Quality. That
leaves only quality control measurements, which are inputs to the Manage Quality process.

Explanation The responsibility assignment matrix maps speciﬁc resources to the work packages from
the W’BS. On a resource histogram, the use of resources is shown individually or by groups over time.

Explanation This scenario deals with the agile concept of fast failure, where we want to determine
if a project is viable as fast as possible. If a risky project won’t work, it’s better to know that quickly so
that resources can be reassigned to more productive eﬁerts. To determine project viability, agile teams
typically use architectural spikes to do proof-ef-cencept testing, so the correct answer is to perform
proof-of-concept tests before starting development. While the word "spike” isn’t used in that answer,
it describes the work done in an architectural spike. Beginning development work before proving the
concept would delay potential failure, costing more. The risk-based and exploratory spikes described
in the other two answers might be helpful for speciﬁc issues, but they would not address the overall
prej ect viability.

Explanation Often, the seller is required to inform the buyer of anything that is missing or unclear
in the procurement documents. It is in the buyer’s best interest to discover missing items, since it will
save the buyer money and trouble to correct the problem early. Procurement documents must include
terms and conditions and selection criteria, as well as documentation of all the work that is to be
done (which includes the procurement statement of work). This is so the seller can price the project
and know what is most important to the buyer. Well—designed procurement documents can simpliry
comparison of responses. This is an important point and is the best answer.

Explanation: Agile prioritizes delivering value, but the speciﬁc deﬁnition of that value is likely to
change over the course of a project. So the best option here would be to simply require that the
completed deliverables be ﬁt for business purpose. To ensure this, the project manager will need to
have ongoing communication and collaboration with the subcontractors. While successful testing
might be a requirement, this broader statement would cover that , as well as any other criteria related
to quality, scope, or timely delivery. Agile doesn’t focus on working to the original speciﬁcation. In
an uncertain project environment, the true requirements aren’t known upfront; they emerge as the
work is being done. Agile doesn’t prioritize scope over schedule. in fact on an agile project usually the
opposite is the case—typically, the scope may vary but the deadline is ﬁxed.

Explanation By paying the additional amount of this month’s invoice, the buyer may waive the right
to limit monthly costs to $ 10,000. The project has allocated $ 10,000 per month for this seller, and the
buyer may not have the capacity to pay more each month. By agreeing to the terms of the contract, the
seller is contractually obligated not to exceed that amount. A breach of contract notice from the buyer
to the seller is the best way to handle this situation.

Explanation If you got this question wrong, reread it. You need to audit invoices in all contract
types, so how do you choose? Look for the answer that is best. In this case, it would be the choice
that requires the greatest effort. A T3zM contract should be used for low dollar and short duration
contracts (remember that a T&M contract has no incentive to ﬁnish), so it does not have a high level
of risk. PP and FPIF contracts cannot be best, because the risk to the buyer is limited. The buyer is still
only going to pay the contracted price. In a CPFF contract, the buyer pays all costs. The seller could be
charging the buyer for costs that should not be allocated to the buyer. Because of the size and dollar
amount of this type of contract, and because the risk to the buyer is great, a CPFF contract requires the
most auditing. In this case, you would not want to use a CPFF contract.

Explanation Communications were good and there is no evidence that the sponsor didn’t support the
project. The client approved the charter and plan. However, a single unsatisﬁed high-level stakeholder
can threaten project success even if they have, by choice, been only tangentially involved. It is critical
to ensure that all decisions makers are identiﬁed and engaged to ensure their concerns are addressed.

## Answer B


Explanation There are many things the project manager could do. Asking the other project manager
for assistance is not the best choice, as the other project manager might not be an experienced mentor.
I-Ier advice might not be adequate to help this project manager. Waiting to assess the impact on the
project is reactive; a project manager should be proactive. Gaining agreement of all the stakeholders
on the project scope is also not the best choice. It would be helpful, but does not speciﬁcally address
the issue in this situation. By contacting the PMO, the project manager can access the knowledge of
many project managers, historical information from many projects, and the assistance of someone
whose job it is to help.

Explanation Connecting the project to the sponsor’s objectives might be a good idea, but it does
not address the issue of obtaining support throughout the performing organization. Neither ensuring
there is a communications management plan nor conﬁrming that the management plan includes
the management of team members directly addresses the need to obtain support for the project.
Correlating the need for the project to the organisation’s strategic plan is the best way to gain support
for the project.

Explanation In the project management process, the project budget, detailed risk assessment, and
project management plan come after the schedule is created. The only answer that could be an input is
the work breakdown structure.

Explanation This scenario describes an incremental life cycle, where complete portions of the product
are developed and delivered one at a time. In an iterative life cycle, the complete project would be built
up progressively, in increasing levels of detail; that is not the case here. While this could be a hybrid
project, the scenario doesn’t mention any predictive or plan-driven methods. Since a hybrid project
is one that uses both agilef adaptive and predictive methods, that isn’t the best answer. The answer
”release-driven” is a distractor, that is not a recognized type of life cycle or development approach.

Explanation Look at the order of planning the project that the team has chosen. Although
understanding the experience of the sponsor might sound like a good idea, the sponsor is a stakeholder,
and understanding the stakeholders is part of stakeholder analysis. That should have occurred before
the creation of a ‘WBS. Project scope must be deﬁned before a WBS can be created. Completing risk
management and issuing the responsibility assignment matrix cannot be best, as that work does
not come next in the process. Other work must be done before risk management can eﬁectively be
completed. Creating an activity list comes next after the ‘NBS and W138 dictionary.

Processes and Domains

Explanation This question is asking which of the choices is the most elfective way to move through
project planning. Starting the W8 immediately after obtaining a project charter skips the important
steps of deﬁning the scope and other activities. High-level assumptions are determined in project
initiating. Quality metrics are determined as part of the quality management plan, not after it. The
activity list is created before the network diagram, so that is the best option.

Explanation A project scope statement is created during project planning.

Answer C
Explanation In comparison to the process groups; the domain tasks are more open to interpretation
and the project manager’s judgment. While both the process groups and domains provide guidance for
the project management process, they do not recommend the best practices that should be followed
on all projects. The project manager determines the best practices that are appropriate for each project.
The domains provide for more ﬂexibility in practice, not the process groups. While the development
approach being used might affect how the project manager will use the process groups and domains,
they don’t inherently reﬂect a different view of the project.
Answer A
Explanation Performance measures are determined earlier in the project so they can be used to
measure progress during the project, determining performance measures is the only correct answer
to this question.
Answer A
Explanation It is important to be able to correlate the process groups and domains with each other to
prep are for the exam. Since they describe the project management process in different ways, this dual
perspective will deepen your understanding of the process. So it isn’t correct to say that they should be
used independently of each other, or that you should only choose one perspective for a project. Neither
of these perspectives deﬁne a speciﬁc order of operations for the work, since project management is
not linear. It is true that the best development approach should be based on understanding the needs
and characteristics of the project, the team, and the organization, but you would use other tools to
analyze that, not the process groups and domains.
Answer C
Explanation A phase or project must be formally closed and accepted.
Answer C
Explanation During monitoring and controlling, project performance is measured and needed
changes are identiﬁed and approved.
Answer B
Explanation Collecting historical information and determining high-level acceptance criteria
are done in project initiating. Gaining approval of management plans is part of project planning.
Conﬁrming that project requirements have been met occurs in project closing.
Answer C
Explanation Project executing is where work is done to produce the product of the project.
Answer A
Explanation Develop Project Charter occurs in project initiating.
Answer B
Explanation These are all reasons projects are initiated.

Integration
F O U R
How would you respond if you were asked, “What is a
project manager’s primary role?” The correct answer is:
to perform integration managementl—to pull all the
pieces of a project together into a cohesive whole. This
is so much a part of a project manager’s job that it is
arguably the reason for the project manager’s existence
in an organization and on a project.
While the work of the project is being done, the
team members are concentrating on completing the
work packages, and the project sponsor is protecting
the project from changes and loss of resources. The
project manager is responsible for integration—
putting all the pieces of the project together into one
cohesive whole that gets the project done faster,
cheaper, and with fewer resources, while meeting the
project objectives.
TRICKS
Think about integration as balancing all
OF THE
the processes and tasks with each other.
TRADE"
Project management activities do not
happen independently of one another. To complete a
cost estimate, for example, factors such as the numb er
of resources on the project, the scope being esti-
mated, and risk reserves should be taken into account.

These tables illustrate that the integration management process from the PMBOK‘E’ Guide can map to
several Examination Content Outline (ECO) tasks. Some tasks and processes appear to be very closely
related. For example, the Develop Project Management Plan process is for the establishment of the initial
project life cycle, development approach, and performance measurement baseline, as well as the integra-
tion of all outputs from the planning processes of each management area. This process directly relates to the
integrate project planning activities task found in domain II of the ECU. And have you considered that
Manage Project Changes from the ECU is similar to what is known as Integrated Change Control in the
.i3’itfiBCIK‘Ea Guide?
The Manage Project Artifacts task from the ECU, on the other hand, relates to both the Develop
Project Management Plan and Integrated Change Control processes from the PMB OK‘E’ Guide. In fact, it’s
likely to be involved in all the integration management processes found within the PMB OK‘E Guide.
Integration management cannot be understood without a solid understanding of project management.
Therefore, if you have limited project management training or experience, you might want to do a high-
level review of this chapter now; read the rest of this book, and then come back and read this chapter again.
It will make more sense the second time. Remember that integration management is the primary role of a
project manager.
Figure 4.1 shows the relationship between knowledge areas and process groups as they are described
in the PMB OK'E Guide. With it you can easily see where a project managers activities are focused for each
knowledge area. For example, all knowledge areas include processes that occur in planning and monitoring
and controlling. Scope, Schedule, and Cost show no project management activity for the project manager
because it is the team that is executing the work to build the product of the project while the project
manager monitors and controls. And did you notice that Integration is the only area that has processes
occurring in all process groups? The project manager is always integrating.

Develop Project Charter
PAGETS
The Develop Project Charter process includes using all the information known about a project from the
project selection process to achieve an approved (signed) project charter, which authorizes the project to
continue. This process also includes the creation of an assumption log, which is an outcome of developing
the project charter as initial assumptions and constraints are gathered and documented in the charter. It’s
also important to note that the assumption log is updated throughout the project as assumptions and
constraints may change and new assumptions are uncovered.
Creating a project charter; involves planning a project at a high level to assess whether it is feasible
within the given constraints. Detailed planning does not happen until after the charter is signed. In project
initiating, you may meet with key stakeholders to deﬁne the high-level objectives, requirements, scope,
risks, assumptionsJ and other constraints in an effort to assess the feasibility of the project. Then. you will
use all the information gathered to conﬁrm the project is realistic, aligns with the organization’s strategic
goals, and is likely to deliver the anticipated value. Additional resources (time and money) are spent only
after the project is o ”'lcially authorized by the project charter.
The project manager may create the project charter; but it is issued (signed off on) by the sponsor as
part of project initiating. The project charter should be broad enough that it does not need to change as the
project progresses. (Any change to the project charter should call into question whether the project should
continue.)
Projects that include hybrid or agile approaches may tailor charter documents. For example, a project
charter may contain less information if there is more uncertainty about requirements or the product
deliverables at the beginning of the project. It’s also important to note that the description of the governance
of the project may contain different information. For instance, instead of a formal change control board;1 a
project’s product owner may be assigned and given the authority to make decisions relating to change
requests and be able to further prioritise requirements. While the detail and approach may vary, the basics
of the charter remain.

EXBI'ClSB Test yourself! In your Exercise Notebook, write the answers to the
following questions.
What does the project charter do for the project and the organization?
Why is it so necessary?
Answer The project charter is your target for the project and serves as a deﬁnition of how success
will be measured. Know the following for the exam.
The charter at a minimum does the following :
' Formally recognizes (authorizes) the existence of the project, or establishes the project
' Links the project to the ongoing work of the organization
' Gives the project manager authority to commit corporate resources to the project*
'
Clariﬁes and encourages a common understanding between the sponsor and project manager
of the major deliverables and milestones
' Deﬁnes key roles and responsibilities
' Provides the project objectives, high-level requirements, and success criteria
*On the exam, the project managers authority through the charter is an assumed beneﬁt or
use of the project charter. In many project situations in a corportate structure, the project team does
not report to the project manager, which can lead to cooperation and performance issues. The
project charter helps prevent these issues.
The process of creating the charter uncovers the assumptions recorded as the start of the assumption
log. These assumptions will later be updated or addressed in the detailed requirements gathering, scope
deﬁnition, and risk management efforts. Can you see that the creation of a project charter should address
and inﬂuence all the project management constraints? Aside from the assumption log and the charter, you
should have the following documented in their respective project artifacts:
I Identiﬁed and analyzed stakeholders
' Deﬁned project objectives, constraints, and success criteria
' Conﬁrmed high—level requirements
' Preliminary product scope deﬁnition
' Documented initial risks and issues
Some of the tools and techniques that can be used during this process include data gathering
(interviews, brainstorming, focus groups, etc), conﬂict management, and meeting management. During
meetings with the sponsor and key stakeholders, the project manager can obtain needed information and
work with experts to understand and address organizational strategy and develop measurable
project objectives.
NOTE: The following charter example is not an exact template as a charter should be tailored to meet
the needs of the business and project. This example is meant to show you the types of sections that may be
included and what those sections may summarize. Also note that this charter refers to attached documents
that are not included in this example.

Project Charter
Project Title and Description ( What is the project?) Upgrade the Payroll Systems
We’re a large, multinational organization with more than 20,000 employees, so human resource manage-
ment is critical to our success. To more e "riciently compensate our employees, we want to replace or
upgrade the employee payroll systems to better reﬂect the changing nature of our workforce. Employees
now work in various locations (o ”Tees and homes) around the world, work simultaneously for multiple
business units, and have more varied work schedules than ever before. Current geographically focused
payroll systems are not integrated, are int esible, and require signiﬁcant clerical time to maintain them
manually. With the existing systems, consolidated corporate reporting and analysis is expensive
and ine "icient.
Project Manager Assigned and Authority Level ( Who is given authority to lead the project. and can they
determine, manage, and approve changes to budget, schedule, staﬂing, etc. ?)
Isaiah Higgins will be the project manager for this project. He may request any team members he sees ﬁt
and will work with resource managers to secure the needed resources. He has signature authority up to
$ 10,000. Ashley Chan is assigned as assistant project manager.
BUSil‘leSS Case ( Why is the project being done? On what ﬁnancial or other basis can we justify doing this
project?)
Administering payroll currently costs $2.4 million annually along with the unmeasured costs of proce-
dural ine '"iciencies. The industry average payroll processing costs for a global company our size is $100
per employee per year, or $2 million overall per year. Anticipated savings of $400,000 per year (assuming
a three-year payback period) justiﬁes the approval of this project. See the detailed business case attached
to this charter.
Resources Preassigned (How many or which resources will he provided?)
The corporate payroll processing group will be closely involved 1n this project, along with the payroll
specialists who work m our local o 1ces. A senior team of business analysts, enterprise architects, and
software designers has been identiﬁed for the initial research and analysis phase. Procurement and legal
representatives will be involved in seller contract processes, including development of RFPs and con-
tracts when deemed necessary. English will be the primary project language ,; local language experts will
be involved to ensure country-speciﬁc regulations and laws are understood. Other required resources
must be identiﬁed and negotiated for by the project manager.
Key Stakeholder List ( Who will affect or be affected by the project [inﬂuence the project], as known to date?)
Attached is a list of stakeholder groups that will be impacted by this project. It includes all employees,
divided into payees, corporate management, legal, procurement, and payroll administrators. It also
includes outside representatives of government taxing authorities, beneﬁt providers, and suppliers of
payroll-processing solutions.

High Level PdUCt Description/Key Deliverables ( What are the key product deliverables that are wanted
and what will be the end result of the project?)
The result of this project should be one or more systems that support payroll processing for all empley-

The systems should allow direct deposit of employee pay into any ﬁnancial institution in the world,
along with notiﬁcation of deposit via email or text message to any device.
Workers should be able to change their address, number of dependents, taswithhelding parameters,
and beneﬁt characteristics via a website at any time from any location.
The systems must support consolidated management and reporting of corporate payroll processing,
plus government mandated reporting and payments.
High-Level Assumptions (What is believed to be true or reliable in the situation? What do we believe to be the
case but do not have proof or data for? See details in the assumption log. )
There are payroll applications available that support the countries in which our employees are located.
The average cost of $ 100 per employee per year is accurate for our industry.
Each employee reports their primary residence in just one country for tax reporting purposes.
We have internal resources available to evaluate and do the work assigned.
High-Level Constraints ( What factors may limit our ability to deliver? What boundaries or parameters will
the project have to function within?)
The system must be able to comply with all international payroll rules and perfenn direct
deposits globally.
The solution and the supporting systems must be able to maintain organizational information
security standards that meet or exceed individual country standards.
Year-end tax reporting must be completed by the new system in the year of the implementation
(payroll data must be converted).

the project constraints.)
The main objective of this project is to decrease costs by at least $400,000 annually. A second objective,
which supports the ﬁrst, is to increase productivity for new employees and payroll processing employees.
Decreas e payroll processing costs by 1 5 percent in two years by decreasing manual clerical processes.

Develop Project Management Plan
PAGE 32
Project managers must plan before they act. Let’s ﬁrst look at what management plans are, and then move
on to discuss the project management plan.
Management Plans
Management plans document the strategy and approach for managing the project
and the processes related to scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, communications, risk, procurement,
and stakeholder management. These plans are in essence a set of documents with processes, procedures,
practices, and standards the team will follow to ensure consistent results. When creating a management
plan, you ask yourself, "How will I deﬁne, plan, manage (execute), and control scope (or schedule, cost,
quality, etc.) for the project?” n‘How will closing phases be performed, if that’s part of the overall project?"
You think ahead, and document how you will plan and manage for each management area based on its
particular needs. This effort should cover all aspects of the project management process. Management
plans are unique to each project, including the format and level of detail needed at each stage of planning.
If you don’t create management plans for your projects this area of the exam may be di "ricult for you.
Let’s consider an example of how you would address cost management. In the planning portion of our cost
example, the following questions may be addressed: “How will we make sure all costs are identiﬁed and
estimated?" "Who will be involved in estimating costs?” "What methods of estimating costs will we use?”

”What historical records, processes, and organizational requirements will need to be used or met?” ”What
estimating tools and techniques will we employ.” ”What level of accuracy is appropriate?” ”How will
funding and cost constraints be considered when establishing the budget?” ”What data, metrics, and
measurements do we need for planning cost?”
Agile and hybrid environments may not have any or all of these plans documented as separate
deliverables. However, this does not mean the planning of these attributes is absent. Rather, they are
incorporated into other artifacts. Scope, schedule, and risk management plans are often incorporated in the
product backlog and the release roadmaps, for example. These deliverables show the plan for project work,
inclusive of risk response decisions and when things are planned for delivery.
The executing portion of a management plan focuses on the processes and procedures for doing the
work. Some management areas, such as cost management, won’t have separate executing processes for the
project manager. The work performance data related to the management area is gathered as part of Direct
and Manage Project Work and must still be planned for. The executing component of a cost management
plan answers questions such as: ”What cost data is needed?” ”Who is responsible for gathering it?” ”Where
will we capture the raw data that will later be used in monitoring and controlling?”
The monitoring and controlling component of a management plan deﬁnes the processes and
procedures to measure project progress, compares actual project results to what was planned, and
determines how to handle variances that require a change.
Before you read further, spend some time imagining what management plans for scope, schedule,
quality, resources, communications, risk, procurement, and stakeholder management might contain. Many
project managers don’t realize how big their knowledge gap is regarding management plans until it ﬁnds
them on the exam. Don’t let this happen to you!
TR|CK3
Here is a trick to understanding management plans for the exam. Know that management plans
OF THE
look forward in time and that there are management plans for all the project management
TRADE"
areas. There are also the following management plans:
'
Change management plan
'
Conﬁguration management plan
'
Requirements management plan
When taking the exam, assume the project manager has created each of these management plans. If
a question refers to a problem on a project, the answer might be for the project manager to look at the
management plan for that aspect of the project to see how the plan says such a problem will be handled.
Or when the work is being done, the project manager might refer to the cost management plan to see how
costs are to be measured and evaluated.
Project Management Plan3
The project management plan integrates all the individual management
plans into a cohesive whole, creating a centralized document to describe what is involved in the project. The
overall project management plan also includes the baselines for the project. Do you remember the
discussion in the ”Processes and Domains” chapter about how the iterations in project planning lead to a
realistic project management plan? This means a project management plan is a set of plans and baselines,
not just a schedule. The key components of the project management plan are discussed in the following
sections. Remember the agile and hybrid differences we discussed in the previous section, and think
through how an adaptive approach may tailor any of the following plans and project management
components.
Project Life Cycle The project life cycle describes the phases of work on a project required to produce the
deliverables (for example, requirements, design, code, test, implement). Project life cycles range from plan-
driven to change—driven.


Integration
F 0 U H
108
gathered, analyzed, prioritized, evaluated, and documented, as well as how the requirements will be man-
aged and controlled throughout the project.
Change Management Plan Controlling a project to the baselines and the rest of the project management
plan is so important that the project manager needs to think in advance about where there might be changes
and what to do to limit the negative effects of changes. Are you this focused on change management on
your projects? You need to plan the project in a way that minimizes the need for changes and prevents
unnecessary changes. You also need to proactively look for needed changes, thereby solving problems
before they have a major negative impact on the project. Because making changes is much more costly than
including the work from the beginning, changes should not be undertaken lightly.
The change management plan describ es how changes will be managed and controlled, and may include:
'I An outline of how changes will be managed and controlled
' Change control procedures (how and who)
' Approval levels for authorizing changes
' The creation of a change control board (described later in this chapter) to approve changes, as well as
the roles and responsibilities of those on the board
' Who should attend meetings regarding changes
'
The organizational tools to use to track and control changes
' Information on reporting the outcome of change requests
' The emergency change process
Note that a change management plan will often have a separate process for addressing each of the
knowledge areas, taking into account the project—speciﬁc needs within each area.
Configuration Management Plan It is essential to have a plan for making sure everyone knows what ver-
sions of the project management plan components are the latest version. The conﬁguration management
plan deﬁnes the naming conventions, version control system, and document storage and retrieval system.
It details how you will manage changes to the documentation, including which organizational tools you
will use in this effort.
Configuration Management Systems Like the change control system, the conﬁguration management
system is part of the project management information system (PMIS). It contains the organization’s stan—
dardized conﬁguration management tools, processes, and procedures that are used to track and control the
evolution of the project documentation.
TRICKS
The project management information system (PMIS) includes standardized forms, reports,
OF THE
processes, procedures, and software for storage and retrieval of project artifacts. It is part of an
TRADE
organization’s enterprise environmental factors and it is here where you will store all project
artifacts, including the change control and conﬁguration management systems to track and control
project changes and artifact versioning.
Putting the Project Management Plan Together
The project management plan, including the
individual management plans and the scope, schedule, and cost baselines, is created by completing the
activities described in the Planning column of Rita’s Process ChartTM(discussed in chapter 3). Once the
project management plan is complete, the sponsor or key stakeholders review and approve it. The Develop
Project Management Plan process must result in a project management plan that is bought into, approved,
realistic, and formal. In other words, the project management plan needs to be agreed to by those involved
in the project, it needs to be formally approved; everyone needs to believe the project can be done according
to the plan, and it needs to remain a formal artifact that is revised and used throughout the project. If this is
a new concept to you, make sure you spend time thinking about how to accomplish this in the real world.

FIGURE 4.2 Project initiating and planning
Once the project management plan has been completed, the project manager uses it as a tool to help
manage the project on a daily basis. It is not just a document created for the sponsor and other key
stakeholders. Although it may evolve over the life of the project through progressive elaboration or
approved changes, the project management plan is designed to be as complete as possible when project
executing begins.
4.2 Exercise Test yourself! In your Exercise Notebook, make a list of the speciﬁc actions required
to create a project management plan that is bought into, approved, realistic, and formal.
Answer Some of the possible answers to this exercise include:
' Select the best life cycle and development approach for the project.
I“ Agree on processes to report, control, incorporate changes, and communicate changes.
' Analyze the stakeholders’ needs, wants, expectations, and assumptions.
' Capture the project requirements as completely as possible.
' Work with team members to estimate the project.
' Give team members a chance to approve the ﬁnal schedule that converts the team’s activity
estimates into a calendar schedule.
'
Get resource managers to approve the schedule and conﬁrm when their resources will
be used.
' Work through iterations of the plan (for example, up date the work breakdown structure after
you complete risk analysis).
' Create the necessary supporting project documents (for example the stakeholder register).
' Apply risk reserves to the project schedule and budget.
' Let the sponsor know if any of the project requirements that were outlined in the project
charter cannot be met.

' Perform schedule compression (crash, fast track, change scope or quality, etc), and present
options to the sponsor.
' Look for impacts on your project from other projects.
' Make sure the approach and processes are consistent with the PMO andX or program
management plan, if the project is part of a program.
If you included most of the answers from the previous list, you are in good shape. But why is it
so important to have a project management plan that is realistic and that everyone believes can be
done? Because while the work is being done, you will need to measure progress against the project
management plan to see how the project is going. The end date, end cost, and other constraints in
the project must be met. There are no excuses. You will use the project management plan (including
the scope, schedule, and cost baselines) as a measurement tool to make sure the project delivers
within these constraints.
So when you think of the project management plan, think of all the facilitations, meetings, sign-offs,
interactions with other projects, conﬂict resolution, negotiations, schedule compressions, etc. that will be
required to bring the plan to the point of being bought into, approve d, realistic, and formal. Expect questions
on the exam about how to use your skills to develop the project management plan, as well as how it makes
a difference as you manage work on the project and solve challenges that occur.
Project Documents
The PMB OKE Guide uses the term “project documents” to refer to any project-
related documents that are not part of the project management plan. They include the assumption and
issue logs, cost and duration estimates, lessons learned register, project schedule and resource calendars,
quality reports, resource requirements along with requirements documentation, and other such
documentation (see page 39 in the PMB OKE’ Guide for a longer list of examples). While the sponsor andX
or key stakeholders will see and approve the project management plan, most project documents (excluding
some documents such as the charter, agreements, contracts, and statements of work) are created by the
project manager and typically do not require sponsor approval.
Due to the iterative nature of planning and the nature of the work throughout the rest of the project,
project documents must be updated frequently. Though this book will not cover these updates as an output
of every process, know for the exam that project documents updates are an output of many project
management activities.
PfﬂjBCl Management Plan Approval
Since the project management plan is a formal document, it
typically requires formal approval by management, the sponsor, the project team, and other key stake—
holders. Formal approval means sign-off (signatures). If the project manager has identiﬁed all stakeholders
and their requirements and objectives, included the appropriate project and product scope in the plan, and
dealt with conﬂicting priorities in advance, getting the project management plan approved should be rela-
tively straightforward.
Klﬂﬁ Meeting
Before the Develop Project Management Plan process can he completed and project
executing can begin, a kickoff meeting should be held. This is a meeting of the key parties involved in the
project to announce the start of the project, to ensure everyone is familiar with its details—including
objectives and roles and responsibilities—and to ensure a commitment to the project from everyone. In
addition to introducing those involved in the project, the meeting may review such items as milestones,
risks, the communications management plan, and the meeting schedule.

Integration
Direct and Manage Project Work
PAGE 90
This process represents the integration aspect of project executing—the part of the project where the work
is done to build the product of the project. In Direct and Manage Project Work, the project manager
integrates all the executing work into one coordinated effort to accomplish the project management plan
and produce the deliverables. In addition, Direct and Manage Project Work involves gathering work
performance data, creating and using the issue log, requesting changes, and completing the work resulting
from approved change requests.
These tasks involve managing the work and keeping people engaged. Ultimately, it’s about being of
service to the team to help them get the work completed, ensuring a common understanding of the project
among stakeholders, and keeping everyone informed by documenting and facilitating issue resolution. The
project manager also facilitates meetings and technical discussions, uses the work authorization systemﬁ
(part of the PMIS) to keep the team and functional managers informed of upcoming work assignments and
milestones, helps remove roadblocks, works on process improvement, and informs other departments
within the organization how the project may affect their work.
Integration management requires project managers to keep all knowledge areas and constraints in
mind at all times and to properly look at how issues relating to one knowledge area affect other knowledge
areas (for example how scope management issues can affect quality and resource management).
TRICKS
If you have never used a work authorization system, imagine a large construction project with
OF THE
hundreds of people working on the project. Can you have a plumber and an electrician show up
TRADE
to work in one small area at the same time? No. Remember that a project is planned to the level
of detail needed for that project. To handle these types of situations, a work authorization system is put in
place to make sure work is only started when a formal authorization is given. In many cases, this tool is a
company—wide system and not created just for the project. The term could appear in a question on the
exam or be included as an answer choice.
Depending on the needs of the project and its development approach, the use of meetings as a tool
can range from informal stand-up sessions to structured meetings with an agenda that focuses on a speciﬁc
aspect of the project. Other meetings may include project updates, lessons learned, upcoming project
activities, and risk management or change control.
The Direct and Manage Project Work process can be illustrated as shown in ﬁgure 4.3. The primary
outcomes of this process include completed deliverables along with any new work performance data and
change requests. Other outputs are updates to organizational process assets and project artifacts.

Information and Knowledge Management
Successful and consistent knowledge and information
sharing contributes to a more productive work environment and increases the ability of project teams to
achieve project and organizational objectives. Successful knowledge management re quires an organizational
culture of trust in which the project manager and stakeholders exchange knowledge without fear of
judgment. The project manager needs to foster an environment that will support collaboration and
knowledge sharing. As an example, discussion forums and other interactive online tools may help to
facilitate this type of environment. It’s also important to note that new knowledge to be shared may involve
experiences that did not work out as planned. The project manager can learn from each unidentiﬁed
stakeholder, each missed risk trigger, and each unrealistic schedule. Sharing such information and possibly
saving another project or person from a similar issue is invaluable. This philosophy has evolved in the
traditional project management world and was built into agile project management from the beginning.
Knowledge management also includes two distinct types of knowledge—explicit and tacit. Explicit
knowledge is fact-based and can be easily communicated through words and symbols. Traditional lessons
learned, processes and procedures, and other information repositories fall under this knowledge type.
These are generated and shared as the project is ongoing and consolidated as part of project closing. Explicit
knowledge, however, may need explanation or context to provide value.
Tacit knowledge, on the other hand, may provide context or explanation to explicit knowledge. It
includes emotions, experience, and ability, which are di ”lcult to communicate in words and symbols but
can be learned through job shadowing or apprenticeship.
On the exam, you may encounter situational questions that test your understanding of sharing
knowledge and information. You may be asked how to establish an environment that encourages the project
team to share tacit and explicit knowledge. Or you may be asked how a project manager would make
adjustments to an environment that isn’t functioning as intended. Answers might include such actions as
holding retrospective sessions and engaging in interactive communication with individual stakeholders.
You should also be aware that legal and regulatory requirements and constraints such as nondisclosure
agreements may limit or impact the gathering and sharing of particular information. For example, on a
project involving development of banking software, the team may have access to personal and ﬁnancial
information of customers of the bank for which the software is being developed. This is an obvious example
of information that team members would not be permitted to share, other than in the context of the
project work.
The Knowledge Management Process
It’s important to consider project artifacts such as the
project management plan and project documents (like the lessons learned register and project team
assignments, for example), along with deliverables as inputs to the Manage Project Knowledge process.
Techniques for learning and sharing knowledge may include workshops, training, and observation. Simply
asking, "Walk me through how you would do this task,” can encourage understanding. Informal sharing
occurs through the application of interpersonal and team skills, including active listening and networking.
The agile concept of osmotic communication describes the phenomena of communication and knowledge
sharing being facilitated and enhanced simply by team members being in proximity to one another.
You will see the topic of lessons learned mentioned often throughout this book, both as an input to
and an output of many processes. As an input, they help improve the current project. As an output, they
help make the organization better. They are deﬁned as "what was done right, what was done wrong, and
what would be done differently if the project could be redone.” Accurately and thoroughly documenting
lessons learned is a professional responsibility, and the lessons learned register is the main output of this
process. Lessons learned should include an overview of each situation, what was done, the impact of actions
taken, and the resulting updates to project artifacts. You should also be aware that your organization may
have a template to be used for lessoned learned. Be sure to determine how to develop your lessons learned
register early on in your project.
In the ﬁrst chapter of this book, we described lessons learned under “General PMI-isms.” Lessons
learned are an essential asset to managing a project, as they are taken into account as well as created
throughout a project.

To make lessons learned as valuable as possible, use categories to ensure that all are captured. Some
categories that should be captured are:
It Technical aspects of the project What was right and wrong about how we completed the work?
What did we learn that will be useful in the future? (Examples include acceptable metrics and vari-
ance levels, new processes, improved or revised processes for particular results, and the effectiveness
of particular acceptance criteria.)
I Project management How did we do with WES creation, risk planning, etc.? What did we learn that
will be useful in the future? (Examples include recommendations for transitioning project results to
the business and operations teams, recommended changes to the organization’s procurements pro-
cess, and experiences working with particular sellers.)
' Management Lessons from communications and leadership as a project manager. What did we
learn that will be useful in the future? (Examples include the results of stakeholder analysis and stake-

Explanation Replanning is uncalled for by the situation described. Reaching the planned completion
date does not mean the project is necessarily ﬁnished. Aproject is complete when all work, including all
project management work, is complete, and the product of the project and all project deliverables are
accepted. The lessons learned are project management deliverables, and therefore must be completed
for the project to be complete.

Explanation Every project must be closed _. as closure provides beneﬁt to the performing organization.
This means simply stopping work is not the best choice. Shifting work and releasing team members
will only postpone dealing with the problem, not solve it. The best thing for the project manager to do
is begin the Close Project or Phase process.

Explanation Who does each activity is managed with the responsibility assignment matrix. When
each activity is done is managed with the project schedule. A work authorization system is used to
coordinate when and in what order the work is performed so that work and people may properly
interface with other work and other people.

Explanation Agile project charters tend to be high-level documents that contain less detailed
information than charters for plan-driven projects. To manage the higher level of uncertainty and
emergent nature of change—driven requirements, teams rely on established agile processes and tools
that (among other things) deﬁne the team members’ working relationships and responsibilities. So
it isn’t necessary to include that information in the charter. Of the options listed, the most important
one to include in an agile charter would be authorization for the product owner to prioritize features
to maximize value. It would then be up to the product owner to gain any approvals that are needed for
the development milestones. While the preassigned resources available to the project could be listed
in the charter, that would be less important than giving the pro duct owner authority.

Explanation On a change—driven project with a high level of requirements uncertainty, it won’t be
helpful to prepare a change management plan to manage changes, regardless of whether the team or
the project manager is doing this. Instead, agile projects delegate change management to the team
or the project owner, depending on the nature of the change. Agile projects would not beneﬁt from
referring changes to a “change management team”, to avoid delaying the work, most changes need to
be resolved as the)r arise.

Explanation The lessons learned register is a living document. It should be updated throughout the
project, for the beneﬁt of the current project, future, similar projects, and the organization as whole.
The communications management plan documents how new lessons learned should be shared.

Explanation Cutting resources from an activity would not save time, nor would moving resources
from the preferential dependencies to the external dependencies. Removing an activity from the
project is a possibility, but because the dependencies are preferential and the risk is low, the best choice
is to make more activities concurrent, as this would have less impact on the project.

Explanation Waiting until all changes are known and then printing out a new schedule is a common
error many project managers make. Instead, the project manager should be controlling the project
throughout its completion. The situation in the question does not provide a reason to believe the
schedule baseline must be changed. A project manager must be in control of the project, rather than
consulting with management before making any changes. Whenever a large numb er of changes occur
on a project, it is wise to conﬁrm that the business case, as stated in the project charter, is still valid.

S E V E N
The cost planning and control processes from the PMBOKE’ Guide are put collectively into the
Examination Content Outline (ECO) as Plan and Manage Budget and Resources (domain II, task 5). While
thinking about the process these tables represent, it is worth pointing out again that many of the same
estimating and earned value measurement (EVM) tools are also used for schedule management.
Estimating is initially done during planning while EVM is used to control costs and possibly resources
and procurement throughout the project. As you balance project constraints to manage costs you will also
do activities related to domain I tasks 1 and 3, Manage Conﬂict and Negotiate Project Agreements. Another
area of overlap is promoting team performance through training (domain I, taks 5) and the use of emotional
intelligence (domain I, task 14). These support value-driven delivery and cost savings. Can you add to this
list of interactions between processes and ECO tasks?
Think about how decisions around funding and ﬁnancing resources might affect project risks and
other project constraints. These decisions will influence how you plan the project across all knowledge
areas and how work will be completed. If you haven’t had to deal with these concerns on your own projects,
it’s easy to miss questions on the erram about how cost—related decisions could impact the rest of the project.
As you read through this chapter, make sure you truly understand what project management efforts you
should be doing when it comes to cost management and what those efforts mean to the project.
Plan and Estimate Project Costs
PAGE 235
Besides having a plan for how you will manage costs, you also need to estimate costs and determine the
budget. The Plan Cost Management process involves answering questions such as “How will I go about
planning cost for the project and who needs to be involved?” and “How will I effectively manage the project
to the cost baseline and manage variances?”
The project charter includes a high—level cost constraint as well as other requirements regarding cost
management on the project. Organizational process assets used in this process include cost data and lessons
learned from previous projects as well as organizational standards and policies for estimating and budgeting.
Plan CDSI Management
In some organizations, cost planning may involve determining whether the
project will be paid for with the organization’s existing funds or will be funded through equity or debt. It
can also include decisions about how to ﬁnance project resources—such as choosing whether to purchase
or lease equipment. As we get detailed estimates and develop the budget, we will use calculations created
for project selection (like net present value, return on investment, payback period, and discounted cash
ﬂow) to evaluate whether the project is still feasible within the charter and whether the measurable project
objectives can be achieved.
The cost management plan can be formal or informal, but it is part of the project management plan. It
may include the following:
' Speciﬁcations for how estimates should be stated (in what currency)
' Levels of accuracy and precision needed for estimates
' Approved estimating techniques
' Reporting formats
' Rules for measuring cost performance
' Guidance regarding whether costs will include indirect costs (costs not directly attributable to any
one project, such as overhead)
'
Guidelines for the establishment of a cost baseline for measuring against
' Control thresholds
" Cost change control procedures
i Information on control accounts or other ways to monitor spending

S E V E N
I Funding decisions
' Methods for documenting costs
'
Guidelines for dealing with potential fluctuations in res onrce costs and exchange rates
' Roles and responsibilities for various cost activities
Notice the inclusion of control thresholds. These are the amount of variation allowed before you need
to act. For example, if an actual cost comes in higher than expected, will you need to act? What if it’s a
two-dollar difference?
Estimate Project CDSI
This process involves coming up with cost estimates for all project activities
and resources required to complete them, to combine into one time—phased spending plan detailed next in
the Determine Budget process.
In the “Schedule" chapter, we included some Tricks of the Trade“Ea titled, ”Things to Knew about
Estimating fer the Exam.” As noted in that chapter, these concepts apply to both cost and schedule
estimating. Take some time new to review that list. It is helpful to have these concepts fresh in your mind
before continuing.
So what costs should you estimate? To put it simply, you need to estimate the costs of all the efforts to
complete the project. This includes labor, equipment, materials, and training for the project, as well as
the following:
' lQuality eﬁerts
' Physical spaces used directly for the project
' Risk efforts
' Overhead costs, as applicable (management
salaries, general o "Ice expenses)
' Project management activities
Types of Cost In the past, the exam has included questions regarding types of cost. A cost can be either
variable or ﬁxed, direct or indirect. Notice a variable or ﬁxed cost may also be a direct or indirect cost.
' Variable costs change with the amount of production work. Examples include materials, supplies,
and wages.
' Fixed costs do not change as production changes. Examples include setup, rent, utilities, etc.
' Direct costs are directly attributable to the work on the project. Examples are team wages, team travel
and recognition expenses, and costs of material used on the project.
' Indirect costs are overhead items or costs incurred for the beneﬁt of more than one project. Examples
include taxes, fringe beneﬁts, and janitorial services.
Inputs to Estimating Costs Imagine having access to a repository containing all the previous WBSs for
projects similar to yours, along with the estimates and actual costs for each activity. Can you see how that
might be helpful in creating more accurate estimates on your own project? Having highly accurate esti-
mates will help you better control the project later and, therefore, save you effort.
Project management plan inputs to cost estimates include the cost and quality management plans and
the scope and schedule baselines. Useful project documents include the lessons learned register, risk
register, and resource requirements documentation. Organizational process assets include policies and
historical records related to estimating, templates and processes including those from past projects, while
enterprise environmental factors include corporate governance, marketplace conditions, commercial cost
databases, exchange rates, inﬂation, and supply sources.
How Is Estimating Done? As described in the ”Schedule” chapter, estimates should be in a range as it is
very unlikely an activity will be completed for the exact amount estimated. It is done using speciﬁc tools
like analogous estimating, parametric estimating, and three-point estimating. From a more general per-
spective, you have top—down and bottom—up estimating.

Accuracy of Estimates Think about someone walking into your e ice and asking you to estimate the total
cost of a new project. The ﬁrst questien you would probably ask is, “How accurate do you want me to be?”
In the early part of the project, during initiating, estimates are likely to be top-down. Over time, as you
break down project deliverables during planning, you narrow the estimate range as you do bottom-
np estimating.

Estimate Ranges The standard ranges of the order of magnitude estimate, budget estimate, and deﬁnitive
estimate are shown below:
' Rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate1 Usually made during project initiating, a typical
range for ROM estimates is —25 to +75 percent. It varies depending on how much is known about
the project.
' Budget estimate Abudget estimate is in the range of — 10 to +25 percent. Abest practice is to narrow
the range (from ROM) before you begin re—iterating the budget.
' Definitive estimate As project planning progresses, the estimate will become even more reﬁned.
Some project managers use the range of +/—10 percent, while others use —5 to +10 percent.

S E V E N
TRICKS
The concept of ranges often appears on the exam. Make sure you understand that estimates
OF THE
become more detailed as project planning progresses. Remember that organizations have
TRADE:
different rules for the acceptable range of estimate for an activity or the project and that what
you see here may be different than your experience. It is wise to estimate in a range, based on the level of
uncertainty remaining in the estimate. Even the approved baseline may be expressed as a range, for
example: $1,000,000 (—5 to +10 percent).
Determining Resource Cost Rates Although many project managers do not have access to this informa—
tion on their projects, the exam assumes a project manager knows the actual cost of labor when performing
detailed cost estimating. Resources are not limited to internal human resources. The work of estimating
resource costs might also involve estimating the work of consultants, sellers, and suppliers.
Other tools and techniques particular to cost estimating are estimating spreadsheets and software
within the PMIS that can speed up calculation and analysis and integrate ﬁnance and accounting. Quality
risk and scheduling tools are useful here as well. Alternatives analysis, resources analysis, and decision
making (all discussed in the "Schedule” chapter) may also be used as part of the Estimate Costs process.
The Estimate Costs process results in cost estimates and an explanation of how these estimates were
derived (the basis of estimates). It can also result in project document updates, such as the risk register,
assumption log, and lessons learned register.
Determine Budget
In this part of cost management, the project manager calculates the total cost of the
project to determine the budget. Meeting the cost baseline will be a measure of project success, so the
budget should be in a form the project manager can use to control costs while the work is being done.
To begin the Determine Budget process, it’s important to review the business case and the beneﬁts
management plan. The business case may be expressed in ﬁnancial terms, such as expected return on
investment. The beneﬁts management plan can be used to ﬁnalize the budget and compare it to the
economic beneﬁts expected from the project.
On adaptive projects, project teams help determine the budget based on the project scope. This
typically requires the team to break down the scope using techniques such as T—shirt sizing, planning poker,
and ahnity estimating, for example. The team will then plan releases using story maps. Refer to the
"Schedule” chapter for a review of these concepts, if necessary. Teams on adaptive projects may also use
retrospectives to determine the accuracy of budget estimates, and if any adjustments should be made to the
budget. For instance, if a team’s retrospective uncovers a recurring pattern of underestimating costs, the
team may decide to try more analysis before they ultimately determine the budget.
Two outputs from Estimate Costs— co st estimates and the basis of estimates—are essential inputs to
this process. Many of the inputs to Estimate Costs are used here as well: the cost management plan, the
scope baseline, the project schedule, the risk register, existing policies on cost control and cost budgeting,
and resource requirements documentation (for how long and at what rates for particular resources, for
example). Agreements regarding the purchase of services or products for the project are also inputs.
To create a budget, activity cost estimates are rolled up to work package cost estimates. Work package
costs are then rolled up to control account costs and ﬁnally to project costs. This process is called cost
aggregation. After risk management planning, contingency reserves are added to determine the cost
baseline. These are shown at the project level, as described here and depicted in ﬁgure 7.1, but note it is also
possible to add contingency reserves at the activity level. In the ﬁnal step, the management reserves are
added. Note that it is the management reserves that make the difference between the cost baseline and
the budget.
Cost
227


S E V E N
for a team is $50,000 per month, you can quickly estimate the cost for the next six months is likely to be
6 x $50,000 = $300,000. Project managers on adaptive projects do the majority of their cost estimating for
projections and estimates at completion based on extrapolation of burn rates.
The project budget must be reconciled with any cost constraints in the charter. If the project estimate
exceeds the constraints, the project manager must meet with management, explain why their cost
requirement cannot be met, and propose options to decrease costs. Pay particular attention to that last
sentence. As with the schedule, project managers have a professional responsibility to reconcile the budget
in this way.
When the Determine Budget process is complete, the cost baseline, including all funding requirements,
is established. Naturally, many of the inputs to the process will be updated, such as the cost estimates, the
risk register, and the project schedule.

This mindset will help you select the best choice when answering questions that seem to have
TRADE more than one correct answer.
7.1 Exercise In your Exercise Notebook, list the actions a project manager may take to control
costs. (This is an important topic, so be sure to take your time to think about this question.)
Answer
' Follow the cost management plan for how to control costs
' Tailor control activities to the needs of the project
'I‘ Consider policies, pro cedures, to ols and rep orting templates and formats related to controlling
costs (selected from organizational process assets during planning)
' Measure project performance and compare it against the plan
' Determine if variances require change, including preventive and corrective action
' Request changes
' Implement approved changes
' Prevent unnecessary changes
' Look for the root cause of factors causing costs to rise
' Conduct reserve analysis
' Conduct earned value measurement
' Aggregate data, analyze it, and produce reports
Controlling costs is an important responsibility for project managers, but you must also understand
and plan for potential budget variations. For instance, your team worked overtime to complete a new
feature for an upcoming sponsor demo. While the new feature was completed on time, the overtime work
means your monthly budget goal for payroll will be missed. As the project manager, you weighed the value
of this through a simple analysis of beneﬁts and costs. The beneﬁt outweighed the cost, so you approved the

overtime, but you must also keep this decision in mind while forecasting future monthly budgets. Was this
month’s higher payroll atypical or has your team consistently needed overtime hours to complete the
necessary work? Should you adjust the budget for future months or adjust the schedule to avoid
unnecessary overtime?
There can be a lot of unplanned scenarios that impact the overall budget of a project, and these costs
may not be avoidable. As the project manager, you should look for likely costs, anticipate the potential risks,
and plan ahead. You will never be able to foresee everything, but if you try to imagine the unplanned costs
on your project, you will have a much easier time planning a realistic budget.
Progress Reporting
Progress reports convey information based on data analysis. The project manager
uses information about project progress to help control the schedule and costs and to assess whether the
project is on track through earned value analysis (described later in this section). Some project managers
use alternative means of determining progress, such as asking team members to estimate percent complete
for deliverables. Simply asking for percent complete does not result in a realistic estimate of progress. You
can more carefully track progress without using earned value analysis by accurately measuring deliverable
completion at the work package level based on cost and schedule estimates. For example, with a WES, 80
hours is a small enough work increment to track progress against and still have accurate data. For the exam,
remember that projects using proper project management make use of a MS, and activities to produce
work packages are broken down to an appropriate level for controlling.

Reserve analysis allows you to identify and apply lessons learned in controlling
costs. Remember the contingency reserves that get factored into the cost baseline to address known risks?
Part of cost control is analyzing where those contingency reserves are still necessary or where new reserves
are required. For example, let’s say a project team identiﬁes a highly ranked risk and sets aside a contingency
reserve to address it. If the risk does not occur and is no longer a threat, the contingency reserve can be
removed from the cost baseline. Or, a risk review on a project may identify new risks, which could lead to a
decision to increase the contingency reserves. Both of these examples require a change request being
submitted through integrated change control. A change request is also required to move management
reserve funds into the cost baseline for a similar purpose. It may also be necessary to reassess the amount of
management reserve that was set aside to address unknown risks.
Earned Value MBBSUeBHl3
Earned value measurement is a data analysis technique used to measure
project performance against the performance measurement baseline (the scope, schedule, and cost
baselines). The resulting measurements indicate whether there are any potential deviations from the
performance measurement baseline. Many project managers manage project performance by comparing
planned to actual results. With this method, however, you could easily be on time but over budget. Earned
value analysis integrates cost, time, and scope and can be used to forecast future performance and project
completion dates and costs.
Earned value measurement is on the exam and questions often contain formulas. Are you worried
about it? Don’t be. We are going to make it easier. First, think about this: How valuable would it be to know
how your project is really going? Could you sleep better at night? Would you be able to spend your time in
more productive ways than worrying? Ifyou currently rely on hope, guesses, or a general percent complete
estimate to assess how your project is faring, you probably know from experience that these methods do
not tell you much, nor are they very accurate. Keep the beneﬁts of earned value as an analysis technique in
mind as you read this section and go through it slowly if it seems confusing.
Using the work performance information gathered through earned value analysis, a project manager
can create reports, including forecasts, and other communications related to the project’s progress. Earned
value analysis may also result in change requests to the project.

Make sure you understand and memorize the following about CV, SV, CPI, and SP1:
OF THE
TRADE:
" EV comes first in each of these formulas. Remembering this one fact alone should help you get
ab out half the earned value questions right.
' Ifit is a variance (difference), the formula is EV minus AC or PV.
' Ifit is an index (ratio), the formula is EV divided by AC or PV.
' Ifthe formula relates to cost, use AC.
' Ifthe formula relates to schedule, use PV.
' For variances interpretation: negative is bad and positive is good. Thus a —200 cost variance means
you spent more than planned (over budget). A —200 schedule variance means you are behind
schedule. This also applies to VAC.
'
For indices interpretation: greater than one is good and less than one is bad. Remember, this only
applies to CPI and SP1. The opposite is true of TCPI.
People often incorrectly answer questions requiring them to interpret earned value terms or acronyms
because they fail to understand the meanings of the terms. Figure 7.2 illustrates some of the differences.
Notice that planned value (PV, what the value was expected to be at this point in the project according to
the plan) and actual cost (AC 5 what the cost has actually been on the project to this point) look backward
at the project. Budget at completion (BAC), estimate to complete (ETC), and estimate at completion
(EAC) look forward. BAC refers to the project’s planned budget; it indicates what the end cost of the
project would be if everything went according to plan. ETC and EAC forecast future performance based on
what has actually occurred on the project, taking into account any variances from the plan the project has
already experienced. ETC is an estimate of how much more the remainder of the project will cost to
complete. EAC indicates what the total project cost is forecasted to be.

FIGURE 7.2 Understanding earned value concepts by looking backward and forward on a project
Earned Value in Action Earned value is an effective tool for measuring performance and determining the
need to request changes. The following is a sample team meeting conversation on this subject.
The project manager calls a team meeting and says, ”We are sin months into this million-dollarproject, and
my latest analysis shows a CPI of 1.2 and an SPI of 0.89. This means we are getting 1.2 dollars for every
dollar we pat into the project, but only progressing at 89 percent of the rate originally planned. Let's look
for options to correct this problem.”

The network specialist suggests that she could be removed from the project team and replaced with someone
less expensive. The IT coordinator suggests either removing the purchase ofnew computers from the project
or telling the customer the project will be two weeks late.
The project manager looks at the network specialist and says, "It would sudden me to lose you, and your
suggestion would improve costs but not schedule. You are the company‘ls best network specialist. Someone
else would not he as proﬁcient as you in completing the work.” To the IT coordinator'is suggestion} they
respond that canceling the new computers would save money but not time. "Let‘is focus on time. ”
Another team member suggests that since the project is doing well on cost. the project manager could bring
in another programmer ﬁ'om the IT department to work on the project to get the next two activities
completed more quickly.
The project manager says, "That sounds like the most effective choice in this situation. Let’fs see if we can ﬁnd
someone who will improve performance, at the lowest cost. Thanks for your help.”
The best way to learn the earned value analysis technique is to use it. The following exercises are
designed to give you a chance to practice both calculations and interpretation. Earned value questions on
the exam have generally required fewer calculations per question than these exercises.
7.2 Exercise The cost performance index (CPI) and the schedule performance index (SPI) can
be charted each month to show the project trends. Based on the diagram, what would you be more
concerned about—cost or schedule—if you were taking over this project from another project
manager? Write the answer in your Exercise Notebook.

Answer Since these calculations were made in the past, the data in the chart is historical data. The
last, most current measurement was in the fourth quarter, which shows both SP1 and CPI being
above one (good). As of the fourth quarter!1 the SP1 is lower. Therefore, the answer is schedule. An
easy way to answer performance index questions that ask whether cost or schedule should concern
you most is to pick the option with the lowest index.

Did you select the correct EAC formula? Ifnot, did you miss information in the question that
could have guided you to the correct formula? In this example, side 2 cost $1,200. Side 3 is 50
percent complete and has cost $600. This suggests a trend that indicates side 4 is like to cost
$1,200 when complete. When there is a trend and no other information to indicate the trend will
not continue, it’s most appropriate to use the BAC/ CPI formula.
On the real exam, round the results of your calculations to two decimal places when you are
ready to check your answers against the choices provided.
7.4 Exercise The Fence #2 You have a project to build a new fence. The fence will
form a square, as shown at right. Each side is to take one day to build, and $ 1,000 has
been budgeted per side. The sides were planned to be completed one after the other;
however, circumstances changed on the project, and work on the sides was able to
proceed in parallel. Assume therefore that the sides have a ﬁnish-to-ﬁnish relationship instead of a
ﬁnish-to-start relationship, so more than one side can be worked on at the same time. Today is the
end of day 3.
Using the information in the project status chart, calculate the following in your Exercise
Notebook. Calculate to three decimal points.

Explanation This is the deﬁnition of marginal analysis. Know the term so you will be able to answer
questions that deal with this concept. The ether choices may sound good, but they are made-up terms.
2.. Answer C
Explanation If a problem with quality were to occur again, many people would opt to ﬁx the problem
as soon as possible. It is proactive, but some other project constraint(s) must change to accommodate
ﬁxing the root cause of the problem. It may not be necessary to allow the schedule to slip, because the
project manager might be able to compress the schedule in other areas. Cutting cost does not necessarilyr
cause the schedule to slip, nor would that necessarily ﬁx the problem at hand. Allowing risk to increase
by cutting cost is not the best choice, because a quality problem is most likely to create additional cost,
rather than cut cost. Allowing the cost to increase by ﬁxing the root cause of the problem addresses
both the need to ﬁnd the cause and the probable impact of dealing with the problem.
. Answer C
Explanation In an agile setting, the development team is responsible for completing the majority of
the quality assurance eiforts as they build the solution. (Some quality assurance may also be done by
a separate testing team, but that option wasn’t listed here.) To do this, the team follows an iterative
process that includes many overlapping cycles of veriﬁcation and validation. Meanwhile, the customer
will be giving them regular feedback to ensure that their work is ﬁt for business purpose. However,
the customer’s reviews aren’t intended to uncover testing or quality assurance issues. The two answer
options that involve checking quality just before or just after release are incorrect because they take
place too late. Due to the cost of change curve, it is very costly to “add on” quality to a ﬁnished pro duct 3
instead, quality should be "built in" during development.
. Answer A.
Explanation Did you notice there is a lot of data not relevant to answering the question? Expect
distractors to appear in many questions on the exam. Quality eiforts should produce a decrease rather
than an increase in cost risk as a result of less rework. Quality efforts should also provide increased
cost effectiveness due to less rework. This leaves the best answer: "Improved quality leads to increased
productivity, increased cost effectiveness, and decreased cost risk.”
. Answer C
Explanation There can be a cost impact (as well as an impact on other project constraints) of exceeding
expectations or adding extras. Quality is the degree to which the project meets requirements.
. Answer B
Explanation Inspection, histograms, and cause—and-effect diagrams are all tools that can be used in
Control Quality Cost of quality is part of Plan Quality Management, making sure the project is not
spending too much to achieve a particular level of quality.
. Answer A
Explanation Cause-and—effect (or why-why) diagrams are often used to stimulate thinking and to
analyse the cause of quality problems. Determining whether a process is out of control is a function of
control charts. Only focusing on critical issues to improve quality relates to histograms.
. Answer D
Explanation Focusing on the most critical issues to improve quality relates to histograms. Stimulating
thinking and analyzing the cause of quality problems relate to cause-and-effect diagrams. Only
determining if a process is functioning within established metrics relates to control charts.

E I s H T
Quality

Explanation Quality training is a cost of conformance to quality. All the other choices are costs of
nonconformance to quality.

Explanation Although this question asks how you want the errors to be identiﬁed , it is actually testing
your understanding of when you ideally want to ﬁnd and ﬁx the errors. Because of the cost of change
curve, the sooner an issue can be found: the better. So we are looking for the answer that is the earliest
time to identify an error—and here the earliest option would be for the developers to ﬁnd the problem
in automated unit testing. (Even if you aren’t sure what unit testing is} you should be able to deduce
that it happens during the development process, before the other options listed.)

Explanation Standard deviation is the measurement of a range around the mean.

Explanation Completion of work packages is done after project planning. Since Validate Scope
is a monitoring and controlling process, that is not next. Identify Risks sounds like a good choice,
however, identifying quality standards occurs before the Identify Risks process. You may have
misread the question and assumed communication planning was complete, but notice it only says
that communications requirements have been determined. Communications planning still needs to be
completed, as do other aspects of planning. Identify quality standards is the best answer choice offered.

Answer A
Explanation Design of experiments is performed in quality planning, and uses experimentation
to determine statistically what variables will improve quality. It allows the project manager to focus
attention on the factors that are most important. Design of experiments is also used in Manage Quality
to help decrease the time and eﬁort required to discover the optimal conditions in which to produce
a quality deliverable.
Answer B
Explanation The unexpected functionality reported by the project manager is outside the scope of
the project. Adding extra functionality is the deﬁnition of gold plating. Gold plating a project wastes
time and probably cost. It makes the project unsuccessful.
Answer C
Explanation Measuring is part of the Control Quality process. Perform Integrated Change Control
is an integration management process. It is likely that the scenario described will result in a change
request submitted to Integrated Change Control.
Answer D
Explanation Changing the communications management plan may not be needed, and it does not
deal with the problem at hand—the policy that is slowing things down. Conﬁrming the department
manager’s opinion with someone else in the department is not the best choice, as the project manager
already has heard the opinion on many other occasions. It is already conﬁrmed. Determining whether
upcoming activities should be reestimated is just being reactive. A good project manager will ﬁnd
the root cause and deal with that, even if it means attempting to improve the company’s policies
and processes. Yes, recommending improvement of the policy is the best answer. This is continuous
improvement. Because there are several activities affected by the policy, it would best serve the project
to get to the root cause of the problem and solve it.
Answer D
Explanation As the servant leader of an agile team, it’s essential to cultivate an open environment
where people feel safe to fail and make mistakes. In a scenario such as this, the ﬁrst step would be
to discuss the issue privately with the develop er. It wouldn’t be appropriate to bring this up with the
entire team in the retrospective, unless you and the person who made the mistake agree beforehand
that this would be a good learning opportunity for the other team members. Raising this issue without
discussing it privately ﬁrst would just embarrass the developer and put them on the defensive—
creating the opposite of a safe and open environment. Since this person is the lead developer, the
problem probably isn’t due to a lack of skills or training. Although agile teams try to solve problems
collectively, this appears to be a simple scenario of one individual who made a mistake. Alerting the
testing department wouldn’t help solve the problem and would be likely to stir up unnecessary gossip
and trouble.
Answer C
Explanation All reports and diagrams are communications tools. This question asks you to pick the
most appropriate quality tool to help communications. A why-why diagram, also called a cause-and-
effect or Ishikawa diagram, is more appropriate than a Pareto diagram since you are trying to determine
the causes. Once causes are known and you have data on occurrences, the data can be displayed in a
Pareto diagram.
Answer D
Explanation Look for the proactive approach. When we plan for quality, we deﬁne the appropriate
level of quality needed, which will improve quality overall and will likely be less expensive in the long
run. NOTE: You may spend more initially on determining the right level of quality and doing the work
to produce the required level of quality, but you will save through reduced rework, waste, and scrap.

9.1 Exercise Do you remember the discussion on project roles in the "Framework” chapter?
Your understanding of that content will impact how well you do on this exercise. You may want to
review these pages before starting this exercise, or use the information in that chapter to ﬁll your
gaps.
This exercise is designed to help you answer situational questions on the exam dealing with
project roles and responsibilities. If you disagree with some of the answers, make sure yen are net
reading something into the question, and assess whether it indicates a gap in your project
management knowledge.
In your Exercise Notebook, write the initials of the key role responsible for solving each of the
problems listed. Because much of the confusion of roles is between the team members (T), the
project manager (PM), the sponsor (SP), and the functional manager (PM), this exercise is limited
to those roles. Consider what you have learned about project roles, and remember to keep matrix
organizations in mind when reading through these situations.

Explanation Although the sponsor may help plan some of the activities, it is not their exclusive duty.
Some project constraints come from the sponsor, but they should be considered necessary. The project
management plan is created with the team and approved by the sponsor and other management. Since
the project objectives are stated in the project charter, and it is the sponsor who issues the project
charter, helping to prevent unnecessary changes to project objectives is the correct answer.

Explanation Know the top four sources of conﬂict on projects (schedules, project priorities,
resources, and technical opinions) so you can be prepared to answer questions that relate to sources
of conflict and how to deal with them. Don’t be fooled because “personality” is on the list. It is not a
major cause of conﬂict.

Explanation Everything we do is more formal in a procurement environment than in other project
activities. Therefore, formal written communication is required when the customer requests work not
covered under the contract.

Explanation: It’s important to plan your communications to a stakeholder or group based on their
needs and interests. In this case, you are reporting to the business stakeholders, so their needs are
paramount. The development team can communicate their performance data to you in any way
that works, since you will be converting it into the most effective method of communicating that
information to the intended audience. The project approach and the amount of time you can spend
will also be considerations, but they won’t be the most important factor to consider.

Explanation Did you remember that the project manager needs to be included when calculating the
numb er of communication channels? Therefore, there are actually four stakeholders to begin with and
six channels of communication. The question is asking how many total channels of communication
you have with a team ofﬁve people. The formula is [a X (n — 1)]/2 or (5 X 4)/2. = 10.

Explanation No calculation is needed. If there is a 20 percent chance in any one month, the chance
in the fourth month is 20 percent.

Explanation This is a tricky question. Although risks can be identiﬁed at any time throughout the
project, most risks are identiﬁed during the Identify Risks process. Newly emerging risks are identiﬁed
in the Monitor Risks process.

Explanation Of the options given, the only contract that limits fees for large projects with limited
scope deﬁnition is cost plus ﬁxed fee.
Answer C
Explanation Party B is only required to deliver what is deﬁned in the contract. The subsequent
contract would usually have a clause negating all prior agreements or understandings. Even if there
was no such provision, even if the notes constituted an agreement it would be considered modiﬁed by
the subsequent written agreement (contract).
Answer B
Explanation Although you have used this contractor before, how can you be sure the company is
qualiﬁed to do the new work, since it is not exactly like the previous work? This is the risk you are taking.
Answer A
Explanation It is generally better to do the work yourself if using an outside company means you have
to lose control or ownership of proprietary data to the other company.
Answer C
Explanation The project manager should attend the bidder conference, although the procurement
manager may lead it. Did you select negotiating scope? Sellers may ask questions about scope during
the conference, but negotiations occur after the bidder conference, when the buyer selects one or
more sellers with whom to negotiate. Allowing ample opportunity for all the prospective sellers to ask
questions is one of the many challenges of a bidder conference. They may not want to ask questions
while their competitors are present.
Answer C
Explanation When a seller does not perform according to the contract terms and conditions, they
have defaulted and the project manager must take action. You might prefer a choice to investigate the
default by contacting the seller and asking what is going on, but that choice is not available here. You
must send the formal written notice as soon as you become aware of the default so that you do not give
up any right to receive the work plan in the future. You can contact the seller for a discussion as the
second thing you do. Therefore, the best choice is to let the seller know they are in default. The default
notiﬁcation letter will instruct the seller to meet the performance requirement.
Answer A
Explanation The customer may be involved in lessons learned and procurement audits, and would
certainly be involved in formal acceptance. Both procurement closure and the Close Project or Phase
process involve the return of prop erty. Procurement closure is done once for each procurement, at the
end of the contract. All procurements are closed before the project is closed.
Answer C
Explanation Even if the contract is terminated before completion, the procurement needs be closed
out. The results of the procurement and its documentation are archived as historical records in the
Control Procurements process.
Answer C
Explanation The source selection criteria are the primary tool for evaluating potential sellers and
should be used by the team in order to make a selection.

Explanation The project manager determines the project schedule through schedule development.
The team and other stakeholders provide the inputs. Since it is also the project manager’s role to
determine resource needs and create management plans, the choices including those roles cannot be
best. The project sponsor approves the project charter, not the stakeholders. Stakeholders do, however,
help determine project constraints and product deliverables. Notice how tricky questions can be ifyou
do not read them correctly! Watch for this in other questions, and pay close attention to the wording.

Explanation The stakeholder engagement assessment matrix can be used to compare the actual
engagement levels (involvement) of individual stakeholders versus the desired levels of engagement
needed to optimize the plan. Any discrepancies can be analyzed, and efforts to adjust the engagement
levels can be implemented.

Answer Although all the following actions are done during project planning, the level of detail to
which each action is performed will vary based on the particular project and approach.
Actions Involved in Project Planning

## Determine how you wt 1 plan the planning, executing, and monitoring and controlling


efforts for stakeholders, requirements, scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources,
communications, risk, procurement, changes, and conﬁguration, and put that information
into the beginnings of management plans.
2.. Reﬁne the high-level requirements from project initiating so they are more speciﬁc and
detailed, and look for additional requirements, being sure to consider any internal or
external analysis, reports, or regulations , analyze and prioritize requirements.

## Expand on the assumptions identiﬁed in project initiating, looking for new assumptions


and documenting the details of the assumptions.

## Reﬁne the high-level constraints (such as resources, schedule, and cost) from project


initiating so they are more speciﬁc and detailed.

## Create a description of the project deliverables, the work required to complete those


deliverables, and their acceptance criteria (project scope statement).

## Use the project scope statement to gain approval of the “ﬁnal” scope from stakeholders


before further planning is done.

## Assess what may need to be purchased on the project. Identify any pieces of work that may


be outside the organisation’s abilities to complete, and determine if new equipment or
technology is needed to perform the project work.

## Select the procurement strategy for each contract. Create a draft of the procurement


documents for necessary contracts, including bid documents, procurement statements of
work, source selection criteria, and contract provisions.

## Determine what subject matter experts you will need on the project team to help with


project planning.
10.
Engage a business representative as a pro duct owner.

## Break down the deliverables into smaller, more manageable pieces into aWBS (Work


Breakdown Structure) (or for agile, create a product backlog).
12.. Create descriptions of each WBS entity in a WBS dictionary so that the work can be
understood and produced without gold plating.

## Break down the work packages from the WBS into lists of activities to produce them.

## Carryout contingency plans in response to risk triggers.


Notice that “solves problems” is only one of 48 items on the list of actions to be done during executing.
As a project manager, you should be focused on preventing problems so you do not have to deal with them.
With proper project management, problems occur less often, and should not have a major impact on the
project. Assume risk management efforts have identiﬁed and evaluated risks, and that contingency plans
are in place to deal with risks that have high probability or imp act ratings. Instead of handling risk events,
you can spend your time engaging stakeholders and encouraging team members.
Did you list meetings? Effective agile teams, for example, have focused daily stand-up meetings to
keep the team on track to complete their work for an iteration. The occasions when the team gets together
are too important to just focus on collecting status. How about reviewing risk triggers and upcoming
contingency plans during meetings?

## Update the risk report to keep key stakeholders informed about the status of overall


project risk and the highest-ranked individual risks.
When a project has been planned appropriately, most control eﬁorts result in information that shows
work is being done according to the plan and that scope is being produced to the agreed—upon standards
and metrics. Results of measurements and outcomes of other monitoring and controlling efforts are added
to the project management plan and project documents as updates. In fact, project artifact updates (to the
project management plan and project documents) are outcomes of every monitoring and controlling
process. Records of the work, measurements, and lessons learned are used for reference and comparison
throughout the life of the project. In addition to identifying variances, measurements can be useful in trend
analysis, forecasting, and estimating the remaining work.
Since monitoring and controlling is so challenging, let’s look at this another way. We have included the
following information by knowledge area (or constraint) to help you develop a better overall understanding
of project monitoring and controlling.

closing. Project closing, where the project is ﬁnished, is one of the most ignored parts of the project
management process. However, if you take time now to understand the concepts from this section,

## Celebrate!


Because many organizations do not require formal closure procedures, let’s take a moment to discuss
some of the key actions listed in the previous table that many people miss.
Conﬁrming that all the requirements have been met may seem unimportant; however, most studies
show that many requirements are not met on projects. This conﬁrmation needs to take place and can be
done by reviewing the project management plan and accepted deliverables.
What about handing off the completed project deliverables to operations and maintenance? Work
involved in completing such a transfer is considered part of the project. The work could include meetings
to explain the project nuances, training, documentation for maintenance, and other activities as needed.
Now let’s think about formal sign-off and acceptance. These are important because they conﬁrm that
the customer considers the project completed and accepts the whole project. Without that acceptance, you
cannot be sure the project was ﬁnished.
Measuring customer satisfaction is another important part of project closing. Have you ever had a
customer accept your work although they were not happy with the project? Just like lessons learned,
measuring customer satisfaction should be ongoing throughout the project, but it must occur during
project closing.
In the ﬁrst chapter of this book, we noted that historical records are a PMI-ism. For the exam, make
sure you understand the value of these records and the project manager’s and teams responsibility for
creating them. Historical information is collected throughout the project, but it is during project closing
that the ﬁnal versions of the lessons learned are compiled and archived in the lessons learned repository.

T H n E E
Processes and Domains
Some project managers consider completing the ﬁnal project performance report and holding an
end-of—the-project celebration to be unimportant. However, the ﬁnal report communicates to all
stakeholders and the entire organization beneﬁts achieved by the team members’ efforts on the project.
Project Management by Domains
For the exam, you should know the following three domains: People, Process, and Business Environment.
These domains and their processes (or tasks) support and are supported by one another. So think about
them in terms of an integrated whole. Together they reﬂect the evolving nature of project management as
these domains are more inclusive of all project management approaches, from predictive to change-driven
and hybrid. As such, the project management concepts presented within these domains are more open to
interpretation than one may ﬁnd within the traditional ﬁve process groups. It’s important to know that the
knowledge areas are still covered within these domains, but they are not organized in the same way as they
occur within the ﬁve process groups as listed in the PMBOK® Guide.
This does not mean that the order in which a project occurs has changed; it simply means that a
project manager can and should apply and adapt their project management approach to ﬁt the needs of any
given project. Managing the knowledge areas (many of which are project constraints) is the main focus of
the Process domain. People domain tasks and the skills they require relate to and enable the tasks within
the Process domain, and contribute to their overall success. The Business Environment domain and its
associated tasks relate to the environment in which projects exist. A solid understanding of the Business
Environment domain along with the interpersonal and team skills, like those relating to the People domain,
support the technical project management skills in the Process domain.
Domain '2 People
The People domain relates to several tools and techniques along with a unique set of
skills that may include the following: leadership, team building, motivation, and conﬂict management. This
domain also relates to the ability to interact with and support the needs of project stakeholders. This can
mean from the sponsor to the project team and the performing organization, and from the customer to the
larger community in which all stakeholders work together. Stakeholder engagement is as much about
managing expectations as it is about meeting them. To build and maintain a shared understanding, you
must deliver the overall value of the project within scope while simultaneously managing expectations.
Note that while PMI states that 42% of the exam is based on the People domain, the associated tasks
and skills are not only needed for project communications, they are inherent in your work as a project
manager. They are also needed in order to carry out the project management processes and successfully
navigate the business environment within the context of a project. A project manager needs a unique set of
soft skills, abilities, and personal attributes to carry out the tasks within this domain and to support the
Process and Business Environment domains. They are covered directly or indirectly throughout this book,
but especially in the “Resources,” "Communications,” and "Stakeholders” chapters. The following list is a
good representation of the skills, abilities, and attributes needed to manage a project:
' Active listening
' Negotiation
' Adaptive leadership
' Participatory decision making
' Coaching and mentoring

participatory decision making, and conﬂict resolution are all likely to be used. Remember
that conﬂict resolution is more likely to be about project priorities and constraints,
technical considerations, and differences of expert opinions than about personalities.

## Personal integrity and trust building are important as you establish a good relationship with


the seller. Collaboration and negotiation are important to obtaining a fair and equitable
price and conditions of the contract. Did you automatically think of conﬂict resolution?
That would not have been wrong either. Conﬂict is possible during any human interaction
on a project.

## Using emotional intelligence and understanding human motivation will help you appreciate


the need to help stakeholders manage their transition to the new pro duct. With conﬂict
resolution you can help them navigate changes to their ways of working.

Processes and Domains
Domain "I Process
The Process domain includes the technical project management skills and
activities needed to manage a project with the overall goal to deliver the beneﬁts for which the project was
undertaken. The project manager and project team work together in this effort, so, as you would expect, you
are using the skills needed from the People domain. You lead the development and organization of the
project with these skills and a deep and balanced understanding of the business environment in which you
and the team continually deliver value.
The project management tasks within this domain include not only the management of stakeholder
engagement] resources, and communications but scope!1 schedule, cost, quality, risk, and procurement
management, all of which are covered in the following chapters of this book. You are also primarily
responsible for keeping the project’s many aspects integrated, as in managing the project planning and
artifacts. Managing the project governance structure, changes, issues, and the transfer of lessons learned
and other knowledge, as well as the product turnover are all part of this domain. Remember that a key
measure of success beyond turnover is the continuation of the project’s resulting value and beneﬁts (which
is also a domain III task).

Answer As you read these answers , note the skills from domain I: People. You may think of others
that apply as well.

## Requirements documentation is needed for scope deﬁnition:1 and stakeholder engagement


is integral to successfully completing both. Creating a precinct backlog or WES could also
be involved depending on where we are in the project management process.

## You are meeting with the customer to gain approval fer a deliverable. That is validate scope.


Change management activities are needed to adjust the deliverable as a result of customer
feedback. You and the project team would verify pro duct quality before ﬁrst presenting it
fer approval and again after making the requested adjustments.

## The project team should always be engaged in the project (the process—of stakeholder


engagement). The team leadership and communications management pro cesses help you
lead them adaptively thro_ug_h the process of becoming a performing team.

## Di ”icnlt scheduling issues could be serious risks on projects so there must be a risk


assessment (and possibly a risk response plan if it cannot be immediately resolved). You will
have had to identify and analyze stakeholders to understand how you might help resolve
their scheduling issue. How related communications take place is a communications
management issue.

## Balancing labor expenses against task proﬁciency is the balancing of the processes of cost,


schedule, and quality management. The most proﬁcient team resource choice is likely to
have the most experience and their labor will cost more, but that could increase the quality
of the work and also help to compress the schedule. Note that if we were looking at an
external resource, the procurement process would be involved.
Domain lll'.‘ Business Environment
Projects occur within the larger organization and business
environment. Let’s say you have the skills associated with domain I and you have the knowledge of and
experience with the project management processes of domain 11. You would still need a solid understanding
of the business environment within which the project occurs. It is likely that you already understand this,
but you may not have thought about it as a separate factor in your success. The presentation of the business
environment as a separate domain helps you understand how critical this is to accomplishing project
objectives and delivering value. Note that one of the associated tasks within this domain speciﬁcally states
that you should evaluate and deliver project beneﬁts and value. This can only be achieved if a project
manager uses the skills related to domains I and 11 together with a complete understanding of the
business environment.
It’s also important to have knowledge and understanding of project and organizational lessons learned
and the importance of how they are used between projects. A project manager receives lessons learned
from organizational process assets at the beginning of a project. Throughout a project, lessons learned may
be collected!1 used, and then shared with other projects and project managers. Can you see how lessons
learned become integrated back into organizational process assets for use on future projects and within the
organization at large? (This is further described in the “Framework” chapter.)
Organizational and project governance (see the "Framework” chapter) are both essential to overall
project success as it relates to the business environment. Organizations evaluate the external business
environment during project selection (also in the ”Framework” chapter). The environment is also
continuously evaluated throughout the project to ensure that changes do not affect procurements , project
objectives, and other project needs. Many projects have a change management component that addresses
the changes to ways of doing business that are caused by the project. For example, a project whose goal it is
to update the automation of a process that affects large parts of the organization requires a large
communications eﬂort before, during, and alter the project is executed. There may be a separate
implementation and training project to introduce the product of the project to its customers so it can be
successfully used as intended.

Structural Differences: The Process Groups and Domains
Historically! the ﬁve process groups existed long before the current domains. It is critical to understand
how both describe the project management process in different ways and that they correspond to one
another. In either case, you are doing the same basic things: initiating, planning , following through on your
plan, measuring and analysing your progress against measureable project objectives, adjusting plans, and
making changes along the way.
It is useful to comp are the two. The domains structure provides a more ﬂexible framework than
presented in the ﬁve process groups and has a number of advantages as a result. For eitampleJ it may require
less adapting for a change-driven approach compared to a predictive approach.
Review the following differences between the domains and process groups to understand how the
domains have been structured compared to the ﬁve groups:
' No indication of a set order Remember:1 project management is not linear. We made this statement
earlier in relation to the five process groups, but the domains make this concept more clear. Since
there is no indication of an order of operations within the domains, there is no false sense that all your
project management activities are started and ﬁnished one after the other. In fact, there are iterations
and progressive elaboration regardless of the applied methodology.
'- No deﬁnitive framework A lack of deﬁnitive framework allows for more ﬂexibility to select from
development approaches along the continuum of predictive to hybrid to change—driven.
87

Processes and Domains
T H n E E
88
' No direction in relation to how tasks may be connected While the structure of the ﬁve process
groups provides direction related to all project management processes, the domains only describe
skills and activities. This means that you need to understand how everything is interconnected and
to know how to connect tasks and the overall work of a project.
' Much is left to interpretation Relative to the structure of the ﬁve process groups, much is left to
interpretation within the domains and their associated tasks. This further allows a project manager to
utilize multiple project management philosophies and methodologies, including whether or not a
more adaptive approach is more appropriate to ﬁt the needs of the project, or a more predictive
approach, or a hybrid approach.
For the exam, it’s important that you understand how project management processes and the tasks
associated with each project management domain relate. Let’s review a speciﬁc task, as an example: Domain
II task 7, plan and manage quality of products I deliverables. Taken literally, you can see that this task clearly
addresses the quality of the product of the project (corresponding to Control Quality in the process
groups). But it doesn’t address the quality of the processes, policies, and procedures for achieving that
product quality (corresponding to Manage Quality in the process groups). You should be able to make the
assumption that producing a deliverable (the ”what” of quality management) includes using appropriate
processes to get there (the "how” of quality management).
This example should help you understand that while there are many similarities, there are notable
differences that you should feel comfortable with. While you will undoubtedly discover other differences
between the way project management is described within the process groups and domains, you should
have a solid understanding of the overall process of project management for the exam.

FIGURE 4.4 Lessons learned on e project
Monitor and Control Project Work moms
The Monitor and Control Project Work process is done from project initiating through closing and involves
looking at what is happening on the project and comparing the actual and forecasted performance to what
was planned. This process involves aggregating the work performance information from the project
management processes relating to monitoring and controlling to evaluate and assess how their individual
results are impacting plans and baselines. For example, scope may be completed but the quality may not be
acceptable, or the schedule might be met but at excessive cost. This process also involves monitoring other
performance requirements that were included in the project management plan.
This work encourages a holistic view of project performance and enables the project manager to take
appropriate action to keep the project on track. The integration function of Monitor and Control Project
Work also includes activities such as analyzing and tracking risks, performing quality control activities,
assessing possible outcomes across the project using data analysis techniques (including alternatives, cost-
beneﬁt, earned value, root cause, trend, and variance analysis), and reviewing changes and corrective
actions made on the project to see if they were effective.
TRICKS
If the exam talks about monitoring and controlling project work, it may not be referring to the
OF THE
entire monitoring and controlling process group. Instead, it may be referring to the speciﬁc
TRADE" integration management process: Monitor and Control Project Work. Remember that
monitoring and controlling means measuring against the project management plan.

F o u a
Integration
Many project managers do not control their projects to the project management plan. If the exam asks
what you should do if a work activity on the project takes longer than estimated, the answer is to request
corrective action (discussed later in this section) to make up for the delay. Such action keeps the project on
or close to schedule and allows the project manager to feel comfortable that the scope will be completed
according to the budget and schedule agreed to.
This effort may result in change requests, work performance reports, and updates to project artifacts.
'Ihe change requests from this and other processes are evaluated and approved, rejected, or deferred in the
Perform Integrated Change Control process, described later in this chapter.
The following sections highlight some important concepts related to the Monitor and Control Project
Work process.
Change REQUESIS
Change requests can have differing focuses, depending on which process they are
generated 1n. Changes may involve additions to the project requested by the customer, changes to the plan
that the team believes would make their work more e icient, or even changes to the policies and proce-
dures used on the project. Needed changes are identiﬁed as you manage the execution of the project and as
part of monitoring and controlling when you measure project performance against the baseline. See the
“Perform Integrated Change Control” section for more about changes.
Change requests are generated from many processes. The three main categories into which they fall
are corrective action, preventive action, and defect repair. Note that corrective and preventive actions
should take place within the existing project baselines, should not change, and should be reviewed and
approved, rejected, or deferred as part of the Perform Integrated Change Control process, as outlined in the
change management plan.
Corrective ABIIDI]
A corrective action is any action taken to bring expected future project performance
in line with the project management plan. Since corrective actions deal with actual deviations, you need a
realistic performance measurement baseline andX or project management plan, including acceptable vari-
ances to determine when a variance has occurred and when corrective action is needed. Those who have
serious problems with this in the real world have problems on the exam. What do you do on your projects?
Do you have predetermined areas to measure, and have you identiﬁed an acceptable range in which the
measurements can fall (control limits) to determine if a project is on schedule and on budget?
You cannot simply jump in and start implementing corrective actions. Instead, you need to:
' Have a realistic project management plan to measure against.
' Create metrics during project planning that cover all aspects of the project.
I Consciously focus on identifying areas that need corrective action.
'I Look for problems using observation, active listening, and measurement rather than waiting for them
to be brought to your attention.
' Know when the project is off track and requires corrective action.
' Find the root causes of variances.
" Measure project performance after a corrective action is implemented to evaluate the eﬁectiveness of
the corrective action.
' Determine whether there is a need to recommend further corrective action.
' Continue to measure throughout the project.

TRICKS
As you can see, a signiﬁcant portion of the project managers time while the project work is
OF THE
being done is spent measuring performance and implementing corrective actions as needed.
TRADE”
You can expect questions about this on the exam. Do not expect all these questions to use the
words "corrective action,” however. Some questions may just describe a situation and ask you, “What is
the best thing to do?" To answer those types of questions, you need to know when to look for
corrective actions.
Preventive ACHDH
While taking corrective action involves dealing with actual deviations from the
performance measurement baseline or other metrics, taking preventive action means dealing with antici—
pated or possible deviations from the baseline and other metrics. Knowing when preventive action is
needed requires more experience than calculation because you are evaluating trends in the measurement
analysis and anticipating that, if they continue, they could lead to deviation from the baseline or other
metrics. Examples of preventive actions include:
' Adjusting the project to prevent the same problem from occurring again later in the project.
' Changing a resource because the resources last activity nearly failed to meet its acceptance criteria.
' Arranging for team members to take training in a certain area because there is no one with the
necessary skills to back up a team member who may unexpectedly get sick.
Proposed changes that would affect the baselines, policies or procedures, charter, contracts, or
statements of work would likely have to go to the change control board or sponsor for approval, as outlined
in the change management plan.
DBTBC’E Repair?
Defect repair is another way of saying “rework.” Defect repair may be requested when a
component of the project does not meet speciﬁcations. As with corrective and preventive actions, any
defect repairs should be reviewed and approved or rejected as part of Perform Integrated Change Control.
Perform Integrated Change Control
PAGE 113
In the previous section we introduced the three main categories of changes requested on a project. All
change requests are evaluated and accepted, rejected, or deferred in the Perform Integrated Change Control
process. A key focus of integrated change control3 is to look at the impact of each change on all the project
constraints, the value of which is to reduce the potential risk of not fulﬁlling project objectives. For example,
any scope change needs to be assessed for its impact on quality, risk, schedule, cost, resources, and customer
satisfaction.
Integrated change control also ensures that as changes are accepted, updates and re-planning efforts
are completed, and project artifacts are updated to make sure the project team is always working with
current project artifacts. The approved changes are then implemented in Direct and Manage Project Work,
Control Quality, and Control Pro curements.
So, do you need to go through Perform Integrated Change Control to make changes to processes or
plans that haven’t been ﬁnalized? No! When developing the project charter, project management plan, and
baseline, changes can be made without a formal change request. But after the charter or the project
management plan have been approved, requested changes need to be evaluated in the context of integrated
change control.
TR|C KS
Read exam questions carefully to understand whether a requested change pertains to something
OF THE
that is still in the process of being ﬁnalized or has already been ﬁnalized. This will help you
TRADE
determine whether integrated change control is required.

sheuld be evaluated fer impacts en all the ether censtraints.
Are changes had? In plan-driven preject management and in seme industries this maybe a centreversial
questien. Changes can have negative effects as they may be expensive er disrupt the preject. The cest ef
change tends te increase as the preject pregresses. The function of each precess within menitering and
centrelling is te centrel changes. In an agile (er change-driven) envirenment, hewever, accemmedating
many changes is assumed te be an engeing part ef the preject management precess. The deﬁnitien efscepe
is emergent rather than deﬁned at the beginning ef the preject. But even in change-driven envirenments
change needs te be carefully planned and managed.
A preject manager sheuld werk te prevent the reet cause of unnecessary changes. The need fer
changes in a plan—driven envirenment may indicate that the preject manager did net fully identify
stakehelders and uncever their requirements, plan fer risk, er preperly cemplete ether preject
management actiens.
Te centrel changes en a plan-driven preject, the preject manager sheuld:
' Werk te ebtain cemplete and thereugh requirements as seen as pessible.
' Spend enough time en risk management te cemprehensively identify the preject’s risks.
' Establish schedule and cest reserves (see the "Risk” chapter).
' Have a precess in place te manage change.
' Fellew the change management precess.
1' Have a precess and templates in place fer creating change requests.
I Have clear reles and respensibilities fer appreving changes.
' Allew enly appreved changes te be executed.
' Reevaluate the business case in the preject charter if the number of changes becomes excessive.
' Censider terminating a preject that has excessive changes and starting a new preject with a mere
cemplete set ef requirements.
Changes can be greuped inte twe bread categeries—these that affect the baselines, pelicies and
precedures, charter, er centracts, er statements efwerk, and these that de net. If a change dees net affect
these artifacts, a cempany’s change management pelicies may allew the preject manager te appreve the

Change Control BDHI'CI (CCBF
Depending on the project manager’s level of authority, their role might
be to facilitate decisions about certain changes, rather than actually make the decisions. Many projects have
formally established change control boards responsible for reviewing change requests in accordance with
the change management plan for the project. The CCB then approves, defers, or rejects the changes. The
results of the decisions are documented in the project’s change log. The board may include the project
manager, the customer, experts, the sponsor, functional managers, and others. For the exam, assume that
most projects have change control boards—with the possible exception of change—driven projects.
Summary Process for Making Changes
The exam has many situational questions that deal with
how to make changes. Here are two examples.
Question
A functional manager wants to make a change to the project. What is the ﬁrst thing a
project manager should do?
Question
Someone wants to make a change to the project scope. What is the best thing to do
ﬁrst?
TRICKS
The answers are the same in either case. A trick for answering questions that ask about the
OF THE
process for making changes is to know that, on a high-level basis, the project manager should
TRADE
follow these steps:

## Evaluate the impact Evaluate (assess) the impact of the change on all aspects of the project


(for example, this change will add three weeks to the project length, require $20,000 additional
funding, and have no effect on resources).

## Identify options This can include cutting other activities, compressing the schedule by


crashing or fast tracking, or looking at other options. For example, you maybe able to decrease
the potential effect of the change on the project by spending more time decreasing project risk,
or by adding another resource to the project team.

## Get customer buy-in (if required).


Note in the previous steps that changes are always evaluated before any other action is taken. In most
cases, evaluation involves using data analysis techniques to determine the impact of the change on all the
project constraints.
Next, options to handle the change, such as crashing, fast tracking, reestirnating, and using “what if ”
analysis are considered and evaluated. (See the “Schedule” chapter for a discussion of crashing, fast tracking,
and reestimating.)
Do you remember the following question from earlier in the chapter? It is an example of the type of
question you may see on the exam:
A stakeholder wants to add scope to the project. You estimate that the change will add two weeks to the
project duration. What do you do next?
Notice how the following question is different:
A change in scope has been determined to have no effect on the project constraints. Mat is the best thing
to do?
Be careful when reading these questions. Expect the right answer to depend on other details in the
question. Sometimes evaluation has been done, so the best thing to do is to look for options. Sometimes
evaluation and looking for options have been done, and the best thing to do is to meet with the sponsor or
change control board.

Detailed Process for Making Changes
New that yeu knew the high—level precess, let’s
$5n leek at a mere detailed precess fer making changes:

## Prevent the rent cause ef changes The preject manager sheuld net just fecus en managing


changes; they sheuld pre actively eliminate the need fer changes.

## Identify the need fer a change Changes can ceme frem the preject manager, as a result ef


measuring against the perfermance measurement baseline, er frem the spenser, the team,
management, the custemer, er ether stakeholders. The preject manager sheuld be actively
leeking fer changes frem all these seurces because discevering a change early will decrease the
impact ef the change.

## Evaluate the impact ef the change within the knewledge area If it is a scepe change, hew will


it affect the rest ef the scepe ef the preject? If it is a schedule change, hew will it affect the rest
ef the schedule fer the preject?

## Create a change request Changes can be made to the preduct scepe, any part ef the preject


management plan, centracts, charter, statements efwerk, pelicies and pre cedures, er even the
perfermance measurement baseline. The precess ef making a change sheuld fellew the change
management plan.

## Perferm integrated change centrel Hew will the change aifect all the ether preject


censtraints?
a. Assess the change Dees the change fall within the preject charter? Ifnet, it sheuld net be
a change te yeur preject, it may be an entirely different preject. Ifthe change is net beneﬁ—
cial te the preject, it sheuld net be appreved. Alse nete that any change fer which a reserve
has been created (a previeusly identiﬁed risk event) weuld be acceunted fer in the preject
management plan as part ef risk management efforts and sheuld be handled as part of the
Implement Risk Respenses precess rather than Perferm Integrated Change Centrel. The
techniques ef alternative and cest-beneﬁt analysis are helpful in understanding the full
impact ef a change request.
b. Identify eptiens Actiens te decrease threats er increase eppertunities include cempress-
ing the schedule threugh crashing er fast tracking, changing hew the werk is perfermed,
adjusting quality, er cutting scepe so that the effect ef the change will be minimized.
Semetimes it may be necessary te accept the negative censequences ef a change, if the
pesitive impact that weuld result frem the change is mere valuable te the preject. It is a
matter ef balancing preject constraints. Fer example, the beneﬁts ef adding new scepe tn
the preject may eutweigh the negative impact ef adjusting the schedule te accemmedate
the additienal time the change weuld require. (See the “Schedule” chapter fer a discussien
ef the critical path.)
c. Get the change appreved, rejected, er deferred Again, the preject manager may be able
te appreve many changes. But these that affect the preject management plan, baselines,
charter, etc., weuld likely need te ge te a change centrel beard andX er the spenser.
Decision-making techniques help in this effert. The appreved changes are then imple-
mented in the Direct and Manage Preject Werk, Centrel Quality, and Centrel
Pre curements pre cesses.

d. Update the status of the change in the change log This helps everyone know the status
of the change. If a change is not approved, the reasons it was rejected should be documented.
e. Adjust the project management plan, project documents, and baselines as neces-
sary Some approved changes need to be incorporated into the project baselines. The
changes could affect other parts of the project management plan or project documents or
could aﬁect the way the project manager will manage the project. Project documentation
must be updated to reﬂect the changes. This means replanning must be done to incorpo-
rate the impacts of the change into the new version of the documents and plan before the
team starts executing the change. For example, if there is a change in scope, the scope
baseline (the W138, WBS dictionary, and project scope statement), the project manage-
ment plan, and the requirements traceability matrix should be updated. If that change in
scope alfects other areas of the project, the associated documentation (such as the activity
list, resource management plan and other resource documentation, schedule, budget, or
risk register) also needs to be updated.
6.
Manage stakeholders’ expectations by communicating the change to stakeholders affected
by the change How often do you remember to do this? You could think of this, in part, as
conﬁguration management (version control to make sure everyone is working off the same
project documentation).
7.
Manage the project to the revised project management plan and project documents
Agile Change Management
In agile and hybrid environments, the change control process is
streamlined as there could be a dozen changes to evaluate and make decisions about every day. Waiting for
a formal change control board to meet, discuss, and decide on each change would likely introduce too many
delays. Instead, agile and hybrid approaches delegate much of the decision-making authority to the product
owner. Changes that would not signiﬁcantly alter the outcome or beneﬁts of the project will be authorized
by the product owner. This way the project team is not delayed waiting for the change control.
Note that there are some additional guidelines in relation to agile change management. For example,
the product owner is typically given a description of business beneﬁts to deliver within a ﬁrm budget and
timeline. Changes that would imp act the intended beneﬁts or require more time or budget than tolerances
allow still need to be escalated outside the project to a steering committee or sponsors for approval.
However, everyday decisions and minor changes that come with building something new or complex are
managed within the team.
4.4 Exercise Test yourself I In your Exercise Notebook, list some common changes on projects
and what you would do to manage each change.

Note that the Close Project or Phase process involves getting the ﬁnal, formal acceptance of the

deliverables. The project needs both processes.
Does it make sense to you that the Close Project or Phase process is an integration management
function? If not, think of the example of ﬁnal performance reporting. Can you see how you would have to
report on all management areas? How about the example of indexing and archiving project records? You
need to do so for records from all the areas of project mangement, such as scope, schedule, and cost.
Take some time to think about project closing and how it applies to proper project management
before you take the exam.

## Determine requirements, making sure all requirements support the project’s business case as


described in the project charter.

## Sort and balance the needs of stakeholders to determine scope.


Create a MS to break the scope down to smaller, more manageable pieces, and deﬁne each piece in
the WES dictionary.

## Obtain validation (signed acceptance) that the completed scope of work is acceptable to the customer


or sponsor.

## Measure scope performance, and adjust as needed.


This means that no one can request or add work that is not related to the reason for initiating the
project. Yet, in your real world, do people want work done and try to attach it to any project they can to get
that work accomplished? Do you see scope on projects that doesn’t support the company’s business
objectives? It happens all the time. To prevent it, a project manager must be assertive in protecting the
project. When you take the exam, assume you have the authority to say no when someone tries to add
unrelated scope to your project. Assume you can and do say, ”That sounds like it is a separate project. It
should go through the project approval process, instead of being added to my project.”
On change-driven projects, requirements are identiﬁed and documented at a su ”icient level of detail
so they can be prioritized and estimated at a high level. The work is broken into releases and iterations, and
the work of each release or iteration is deﬁned in more detail just before the work is done. Product scope is
typically more ﬂexible than for plan-driven projects. For example, as essential product features are delivered
in early releases, more optional features may be deferred, sometimes indeﬁnitely.

Scope Management Planning
PAGE 134
Together, the scope and requirements management plans, both ofwhich are part of the project management
plan, provide direction on how the project and product scope will be deﬁned, managed, and controlled.
The project charter, project life cycle description, and organizational process assets are all inputs to the
process of planning scope management. In addition, every project has a development approach. This
approach could be plan—driven (predictive or waterfall), change—driven (iterative, adaptive, or agile), or a
combination (hybrid). The development approach inﬂuences how requirements will be elicited as well as
how the scope statement and WES willbe developed (for the entire project at once, or at a high level for the
overall project, and then in more detail for each release).
SCOPE management Plan
The scope management plan, which is a primary output of the Plan Scope
Management process, is part of the project management plan, and the project manager uses it to guide the
project until closing. The scope management plan essentially contains three parts, which detail how scope
will be planned, executed, and controlled. It describes how to do the following:
' Achieve the overall project scope
' Create the WES or product backlog and stories
' Manage and control scope to the project management plan
' Obtain acceptance of deliverables
Each project’s scope management plan is unique, but it may cover topics that can be standardized for
the company or for the type of project. Therefore, companies can often utilize templates, forms, and
standards for scope management. These are valuable assets to have on a project.
The scope and requirements management plans can be developed in stages or iterated during project
planning. The ﬁrst step is to plan how scope will be deﬁned. The project manager and the team will have
enough information to decide how the scope will be validated and controlled. Those decisions will then
become part of the scope management plan. Another aspect of iterations is that later parts of project
planning, such as the Plan Risk Responses process, can result in scope being added to the project, thereby
changing the scope management plan, project scope statement, WES, or product backlog, and
product roadmap.
Product Backlog?’ A product backlog is a single, visible master list of all the functional and nonfunctional
work identiﬁed for the project. In other words, a backlog is a list of work that needs to be done, and items
are removed from the list as they are completed. It’s also important to know that items on the backlog are
reviewed for risks by the team and prioritized by the business. Backlog items may be tagged with the busi-
ness beneﬁt of the items and the acceptance criteria needed to prioritize the items and determine when
they are complete. Did you know that a backlog item may also be tagged to the stakeholder who requested
it? The backlog is organized by priority from the top down, so the highest value items or stories are always
at the top, which informs the development team where to focus their attention. While the product backlog
contains all the formally recognized scope, low priority items at the bottom of the backlog may never get
developed if the cost to produce them is deemed higher than the value they would return.
Product Backlogs are common on fast-moving agile projects. Having a single source of information
about all the work being done is essential for effective communication and provides highly visible
documentation of the project’s scope and status.
A product backlog is primarily used to ensure adaptability. The backlog is always evolving, and it
needs to be kept continually updated with the latest requirements and new information. Even after a project
is well under way, the pro duct owner will continue to reorganize and reprioritize the backlog. This process
of keeping the backlog up dated and accurately prioritized is called reﬁning (or grooming) the backlog and
is often done in release planning meetings held before the start of each new iteration with all
stakeholders present.

F I V E
Often, hybrid projects use a product backlog for organizing work with the team. The MS (or similar
reporting tool) is then used to share information with the PMO who may be accustomed to predictive
approaches and traditional documentation. In this case, the project manager acts as an interface, translating
and presenting views of work in the format preferred or expected by any given group.
Product Roadmap4 A product roadmap is a visual depiction of the product releases and the main compo-
nents that will be included in each release of an agile project. This is a communication tool that provides
project stakeholders with a quick view of the primary release points and intended functionality that will be
delivered.
Although the pro duct ro admap shows what we plan to deliver in each release, remember that this is a
high-level planning tool—and we know there will be changes. So, in planning each release, we will go back
to the roadmap and conﬁrm that the basic plan will still work or make any necessary adjustments.
The product backlog and the product roadmap work together to help the team plan the project. Think
of the backlog as a tool that guides the work of the development team, while the product roadmap is more
of a plan of how the product is likely to grow. Both tools will inﬂuence the other, and any changes to the
priorities or requirements of the project should be reﬂected on both.
Requirements Management
Plan
In addition to describing the methods you intend to use to
identify requirements, the requirements management plan should answer the following questions: “Once
I have as many requirements as I can gather, what will I do to analyze, prioritize, manage, and track changes?
What should I include in the requirements traceability matrix?” (The requirements traceability matrix is
described later in this chapter.)
Requirements Gathering
Requirements are what stakeholders need from a project or product. Remember, work should not be
included in a project just because someone wants it. Instead, requirements should relate to solving problems
or achieving the objectives outlined in a project charter. Requirements may include requests about how the
work is planned and managed. For example, a stakeholder could request that systems not be shut down to
accommodate a project during peakbusiness hours. Requirements may include the capabilities stakeholders
would like to see in the pro duct, such as a software application that allows multiple users to access it at the
same time. Requirements can also relate to the following:
' Quality "The component D must be able to withstand 200 pounds of pressure.”
I Business processes "You must track and report the project’s expenses in this way.”
' Compliance “By law, we have to meet this safety standard.”
' Project management “We require risk management procedure X to be used on the project.”
The Collect Requirements process looks for all requirements, not just those related to the product of
a project. This process is critical to project success, as a missed requirement could mean signiﬁcant changes
and conﬂict throughout the remainder of a project.
It’s important to note the difference between predictive and adaptive approaches as it relates to
requirements. Agile methods do not attempt to specify fully detailed requirements up front. Instead, agile
teams initially deﬁne the requirements and progressively reﬁne them. This approach delays decisions on
implementation details until the last responsible moment. This helps avoid or lessen the effect of
change requests.
The Collect Requirements process involves using the following inputs to create the requirements
document and the requirements traceability matrix. Review these inputs, and think through how each
input might help you in collecting requirements.

' Project Charter The high-level project and product descriptions are deﬁned in the project charter,
which was developed during initiating. The Collect Requirements process begins with these descrip-
tions, and elicits more detailed input about what is required.
' Assumption Log The assumption log documents known stakeholder assumptions related to prod-
uct and project requirements. Collect Requirements includes reﬁning and adding to this list of
assumptions.
' Stakeholder Register Remember that the stakeholder register was created in initiating. It includes a
list of stakeholders identiﬁed thus far in the project, as well as their requirements and expectations.
' Agreements If the project includes procurements, the requirements of the buyers are documented
in the contracts. Any agreed-up on requirements included in letters of agreement within an organiza—
tion are also a source of requirements.
' Organizational Process Assets Organizational process assets, such as historical records and lessons
learned, may provide data about requirements from past, similar projects as well as information that
may identify commonly overlooked areas of scope.
On large projects, there could be hundreds of stakeholders, and no single method of collecting
requirements will work for all stakeholders. Since missing a needed requirement can be very costly, a
concerted effort must be made to ﬁnd as many requirements as possible before work starts on a project or
development phase.
The Collect Requirements effort also includes eliciting stakeholders’ expectations—their beliefs or
mental pictures about how the project will turn out— and translating those expectations into requirements
as necessary. Collecting requirements may involve using various techniques (described next). The project
manager needs to choose the techniques that are the most appropriate for the project and its stakeholders.
CDIIBCt Requirements TOOIS and TBChnlCIUBS
The following tools and techniques can be used to
collect requirements:
Brainstorming
Be careful here—many people think brainstorming is just a meeting where people
discuss ideas but it is more than that. The purpose of brainstorming is not so much to get individuals to
share their thoughts on a topic as it is to encourage participants to build on each other’s ideas. One person
mentions an idea to solve a problem or, in this case, determine scope. That idea generates an idea from
another participant, which leads to yet another idea, and so on. The results of brainstorming sessions vary
depending on the participants. It can be highly beneﬁcial to include people with different perspectives or
backgrounds. The participants may be internal or external to the project and/ or the organization. After all
the ideas have been captured, the group can evaluate and rank them using the nominal group technique or
multicriteria decision analysis, as described in the following sections.
Interviews
On the exam, this technique may also be referred to as expert interviews. The team or project
manager interviews project stakeholders to elicit their requirements for a speciﬁc element of the pro duct or
project work, or for the overall project. These interviews can take place between two individuals or in group
settings. Interviews can also be conducted via email or phone, or by using virtual collaboration tools.
FOCUS GI‘DUIJS
The focus group technique helps elicit opinions and requirements for the product or an
aspect of the project from stakeholders and subject matter experts. Members of a focus group are usually
selected from a speciﬁc demographic group of customers. They discuss their ideas with each other, and the
conversation is directed by a moderator.
Questionnaires and Surveys
Questionnaires or surveys are typically used for large groups. The ques-
tions are asked in such a way as to elicit requirements from the respondents.
Benchmarking
Another way to help identify and deﬁne requirements is to look at what the competition
is doing. Benchmarking focuses on measuring an organization’s performance against that of other organiza-
tions in the same industry. There are limitations to this technique, however. Benchmarking can be very

F I V E
time-consuming and costly. It may also inhibit the team’s creativity because the focus is on studying solu-
tions that have been used elsewhere, rather than on developing new, innovative ideas.
Voting
Soliciting input about requirements from stakeholders often results in conﬂicting requirements.
It is essential to resolve these conﬂicts, as well as to review, analyze, accept or reject, and prioritize require—
ments before recording them in project documents. Voting is commonly used to make decisions in a group
setting. If the group agrees on a requirement unanimously (everyone agrees), the decision is easy. The
decision-making process is also simpliﬁed if a single person is assigned to make the decision for the entire
group. However, this autocratic method of decision-making can have negative impacts on the project if the
stakeholders do not buy into the decision.
When there are conﬂicting opinions, groups may also take a majority approach. With this approach,
the group chooses the decision that more than half of its members support. If there is no majority opinion,
the group may go with the decision that has the largest number of supporters. This is known as the plurality
approach.
Multicriteria DBClSa Analysisf
Another way to rank ideas is through multicriteria decision analysis.
With this technique, stakeholders quantify requirements using a decision matrix based on factors such as
expected risk levels, time estimates, and cost and beneﬁt estimates.
Affinity Diagramsﬁ
In this technique, the ideas generated from any other requirements-gathering tech-
niques are grouped by similarities. Each group of requirements is then given a title. This sorting makes it
easier to see additional areas of scope that have not beenidentiﬁed. Figure 5.1 shows an example of an
aﬁinity diagram.

Alﬁnity diagrams can also be organized by requirements categories. The following are some common
categories used when collecting requirements:
' Business requirements Why was the project undertaken? What business need is the project
intended to address?
' Stakeholder requirements What do stakeholders want to gain from the project?
' Solution requirements What does the product need to look like? What are its functions? require—
ments (how the product should work) and nonfunctional requirements (what will make the product
effective) ?
' Transition requirements What types of handoff procedures or training are needed to transfer the
pro duct to the customer or organization?
'I Project requirements How should the project be initiated, planned, executed, controlled,
and closed?
' Quality requirements What quality measures does the product need to meet? What constitutes a
successfully completed deliverable?
' Technical requirements How will the pro duct be built? What are the pro duct speciﬁcations?
Mind Maps?
A mind map is a diagram of ideas or notes to help generate, classify, or record information.
It branches out of a central core word or words as shown in ﬁgure 5.2. Colors, pictures, and notations can
be used to make the diagram more readable.

Nominal GI'ULID Technique?
This technique is usually, but not always, done during the same meeting as
brainstorming. It tends to be more structured than other techniques, and follows these four steps: a ques-
tion or issue is posed, all meeting participants write down and then share their ideas, the group discusses
what’s been shared, and then ideas are ranked based on which ideas are the most useful.
Observation
Observation is a great way to learn about business processes and to get a feel for the work
environment of stakeholders. This technique generally involves job shadowing—watching a potential user
of the product at work and, in some cases, participating in the work to help identify requirements.
FﬂBllltﬂta Facilitation brings together stakeholders with different perspectives, such as pro duct
designers and end users, to talk about the pro duct and, ultimately, deﬁne requirements. This technique uses
142

F I V E
a consensus approach, which achieves general agreement about a decision. Those who would prefer another
option are willing to accept the decision supported by most members of the group.
Stakeholders may develop user stories during these facilitated sessions. User stories describe
functionality or features that stakeholders hope to see. They are often written in the following format:
As a {role}, I wont {functionality/goal: so that {business beneﬁt/motivations».
For example: Tits a community organizer, I want the new library to offer public meeting spaces so that
we have a central place to gather and can expose community members to the beneﬁts of the library through
neighborhood events.”
Examples of facilitation sessions include the following:
' Joint application design (JAD) sessions Used primarily in software development efforts, JAB
sessions involve eliciting requirements and input to enhance the processes of developing the software.
' Quality functional deployment (QED) QFD (also referred to as the Voice of the Customer, or
V0 C) is a technique used to elicit and prioritize customer requirements. It is generally used in the
manufacturing industry.
COI‘ItBXt Diagramsg
A context diagram, also known as a context level data ﬂow diagram, is frequently
used to deﬁne and model scope. It shows the boundaries of the product scope by highlighting the product
and its interfaces with people, processes, or systems. Figure 5.3 shows an example of a context diagram for
the payroll system up grade described in the project charter in the “Integration” chapter.

Balancing Stakeholder Requirements
This effort is an important aspect of the Collect Requirements
process. Part of balancing requirements from stakeholders involves making sure the requirements can be
met within the project objectives. If they cannot, then you need to look for options to adjust the competing
demands of scope, time, cost, quality, resources, risk, and customer satisfaction.
This type of balancing is never easy or fast. It can become impossible if you don’t have clear project
objectives and if you don’t identify and prioritize all requirements from all stakeholders during the Collect
Requirements process. Do you try to get as close to ﬁnal requirements as possible when managing projects?
Are your requirements ranked by order of importance? If not, think about how such actions could improve
your projects. When you take the exam, assume that every effort has been made by the project manager to
uncover all requirements and that those requirements are ranked by order of importance.
It’s important to note that agile and hybrid approaches are often used when the exact requirements are
unknown. For example, you may be building something that has not been done in your organisation before,
such as creating a customer self-service portal that allows customers to manage their own accounts. Here,
you may not know what the most popular functions will be or the exact extent of the scope. You may allow
customers to change their own name and address ﬁelds and enrolled services, but what about deleting their
accounts or opting out of communications? Do all of the key stakeholders agree about what features should
and should not be included in the self—service portal? Additional requirements are often uncovered after
some use of the product or service as well. After launching the self-service portal, you might learn 80
percent of customers access it on a PC, but the portal was optimized for a mobile device. You might also
discover a competitor’s portal features a “refer-a—friend” option that offers rewards, and you may want to
create a similar program. Often, scope and priorities change. The longer the project, the more likely the
scope will change due to changes in the market, technology, or organisation.
5.1 Exercise This exercise outlines some of the key actions involved in balancing requirements
from stakeholders. It goes beyond the Collect Requirements process and looks at this effort
throughout the project life cycle. Spend some time thinking about balancing requirements while
getting ready for the exam. This exercise will help you determine whether you really understand the
process.
In your Exercise Notebook, write down the number of each action, read through each action,
then place a checkmark next to the number if you understand the action described. Put an X next
to the actions you are able to apply in the real world. After you’ve gone through the list, write down
the unmarked actions in your Exercise Notebook and spend some time working through them.

Resolving Competing Requirements
Many project managers have no idea how to prioritize
competing requirements. What if, for example, the engineering department wants your project to focus on
decreasing defects while the accounting department wants your project to focus on lowering costs? Can
both needs be met? What if the engineering department is the primary stakeholder or even the sponsor of
the project? Should that department’s needs outweigh the needs of the accounting department? What if
the needs of the engineering department negatively impact the accounting department?
Some issues are so complex they cannot be resolved by the project manager alone, and require
management intervention. However, there are some standard guidelines for balancing competing require—
ments. For example, you should resolve competing requirements by accepting these that best comply with
the business case, project charter, project scope statement, and any project constraints.
A stakeholder’s request to do or add something to the project that is not related to the reason the
project was initiated should be rejected. Ifa requirement is related to the reason the project was initiated
but does not fall within the project charter, this request should also be rejected. Any suggested changes to
the project charter must be brought to the sponsor for approval. When considering constraints, if the most
Scope
145

Scope
146
F I V E
important constraint is schedule, then any requirements that would delay the schedule will not likely be
accepted. Those that compress the schedule (without serious impact to other project constraints) will
more likely be accepted. Requests that do not fall within these guidelines could become part of a future
project instead.
verifying Requirements
Software projects that use agile and hybrid approaches frequently demon—
strate increments of functionality. One common issue is too little interest from stakeholders in early incre—
ments that do not have much to demonstrate. In these early stages, stakeholders are often unimpressed by
the apparent lack of progress or incompleteness of the solution. However, this is when team members want
the most feedback, since they are designing the rest of the solution. Later, when much more functionality
is built, the stakeholders see the potential and start requesting changes and new features, but by then, it is
much more di "lcult and costly to change the design.

FIGURE 5.4
The cost of change to a design
Project managers working on agile and hybrid projects should explain this paradox to their teams and
stakeholders. Teams want to discuss changes when the product design is still in development and the cost
of changes may still be low. This requires the team to have courage to demonstrate incomplete solutions
that may face criticism and the business to have some trust and imagination into how the system may look
in order to provide feedback as soon as possible.
Requirements
Documentation
After requirements have been collected and ﬁnalized, they are
documented. Imagine you have elicited requirements from hundreds of people. Can you see how
documenting those requirements would be useful? This documentation is an output of the Collect
Requirements process and helps to ensure all requirements are clear and unambiguous.
Requirements documentation can contain various types of information, but the one thing that must
be included is acceptance criteria. To avoid having requirements that could easily be misunderstood, a great
question to ask stakeholders is , "How will we know if the work we do will meet this requirement?” Not only
is this a good way to make sure you understand the stakeholders requirement, but it also helps to ensure
the work being done will be acceptable.
It’s also important to note that the level of detail of documentation is iterated until each requirement
satisﬁes the criteria of being clear, complete, and measurable. Requirements must be described in such a
way that associated deliverables can be tested or measured against the requirements in the Validate Scope
process to conﬁrm that the deliverables are acceptable.

F l  v E
Scope
Requirements Traceability Matrix”
Have you ever worked on a project in which some requirements
got lost in the details? In the process of determining requirements, one requirement often leads to
additional, more reﬁned requirements and clariﬁcations—u especially on large projects. It can be di "Icult to
remember where a requirement came from and what its signiﬁcance is to the project. Losing focus on the
reason for a requirement can result in a major strategic or project objective not being met. The requirements
traceability matrix, another output of the Collect Requirements process, helps link requirements to the
objectives and f or other requirements to ensure the strategic goals are accomplished. The matrix is used
throughout the project in analyzing proposed changes to project or product scope. An example of a
requirements traceability matrix is shown in ﬁgure 5.5.
Information such as requirement identiﬁcation numbers, the source of each requirement, who is
assigned to manage the requirement, and the status of the requirement should be documented in the
requirements traceability matrix. For large projects, however, including all this information in the matrix
would make it cumbersome and di "Icult to use. Another option is to store this data in a separate repository,
preserving the matrix as an easy-to-reference tool. For the exam, simply understand that the requirements
traceability matrix links requirements to objectives and / or other requirements, and that the requirements
attributes, such as identiﬁcation numbers, source, and status, also need to be documented.
Assigning responsibility for management of each requirement is similar to the concept of risk owners,
described in the "Risk” chapter. An owner helps ensure the customer receives what they asked for and that
the objectives are met. Assigning team members to manage requirements also helps free up the project
manager’s time. The role of requirement owner is another example of the type of work team members may
do on a project in addition to their eiforts to produce the product.

Define Scope
The Deﬁne Scope process is primarily concerned with what is and is not included in the project and its
deliverables. This process uses information from the project charter, scope management plan, the
requirements documentation created in the Collect Requirements process, the assumption log, and the
risk register to deﬁne the project and product scope.
Remember that planning is iterative. When the requirements have been determined and the scope is
deﬁned, the project manager follows the project management planning process to determine the schedule
and budget. If the resulting schedule and budget do not meet the sponsor’s or management’s expectations
for the project, the project manager needs to balance the requirements (scope) against budget and schedule
constraints. Through iterations, options for meeting the scope, schedule, and cost objectives of the project
are developed. These options are then presented to management for a decision. This work may include
compressing the schedule, identifying alternative ways to perform the work on the project, or adjusting the
budget or scope. The result is a realistic schedule and budget that can achieve the project’s agreed-
upon scope.
The process of scope deﬁnition is ongoing throughout the project. The following are two key reasons
this process is important on the exam:
' Many project managers complain about unrealistic schedules. For the exam, you need to understand
that unrealistic schedules are the project manager’s fault because they have not done planning in an
iterative way. as described in the previous paragraph. Project managers must reconcile the scope to
the schedule and the budget, as well as to other project constraints, to resolve any issues before
work begins.
' Project managers spend a large portion of their time during executing and monitoring and controlling
looking for options to adjust the project and still meet the project schedule or budget. Therefore, all
the analysis tools used in planning to come up with a realistic schedule and budget are also utilized
while the work is being done.
Whether a project uses a plan-driven or change-driven approach, the process of Deﬁne Scope is
iterated as the project progresses. Its purpose is always to determine what scope is and is not in the project.
How would you utilize an adaptive approach when deﬁning scope? Do you know what method you would
use? You’ll need to have an understanding of how to tailor your project and use agile methods when taking
the exam. If you’re unfamiliar with the concept of timeboxing, read the next section carefully and think
about how you would use this technique on your real-world projects.
Timeboxing“l Let’s review the concept of timeboxing. A timebox is a short, ﬁxed period in which a deﬁned
set of activities or work is undertaken. If the work planned for the timebox isn’t complete within the
timeframe given, the team stops what they’re doing and simply leaves the uncompleted work on the backlog
to be undertaken in another timebox. Timeboxes allow agile teams to adjust their scope to achieve the
highest-priority, best-quality pro duct within a ﬁxed cost and timeframe, as depicted in the agile triangle of
constraints, shown in ﬁgure 5.6.
Timeboxes help bring some level of order and consistency to an otherwise highly variable work
environment. They offer regular opportunities to assess results, gather feedback, and control the overall
costs and risks of a project.

and for passing the exam.
5.2 Exercise Test yourself i What is a WES? Write the answer in your Exercise Notebook.
Answer The WES is a visual, organisational tool showing all of the scope on a project, broken
down into manageable deliverables as work packages. It helps ensure that no deliverables are
missed. It is a required artifact for all projects in a plan- driven predictive environment. Read the rest
of this section to learn more about what a 1WES is and how it adds value to projects. Here are just a
few additional answers that may further deﬁne a WES.
' The construction of a WES graphically provides a structured vision for a project and helps to
ensure that nothing, including deliverablesJ is forgotten.
' With a WE 8, you can easily break down deliverables into work packages (smaller deliverables,
not activities). A WES also shows how work packages are derived.
' A WES is created with input from the team and stakeholders. Involving the team and
stakeholders helps gain buy-in, and increased buy—in leads to improved performance.
i The process of creating a WES allows the team to go through a project in their minds and thus
improves project plans. The execution of a project is typically easier and less risky as a result.
' Eeing involved in the creation of a WES helps people better understand a project. It also
makes a project seem more achievable.
' A WES shows a complete hierarchy of a project, making it easier to see how one deliverable
relates to another.

F I V E
Most commonly, the project name goes at the top of a WES. The next level is typically the same as the
development life cycle. The subsequent levels break the project into deliverables, which are then broken
down again into smaller component deliverables, ultimately to create work packages (described next).
Such decomposition continues until reaching the level appropriate to manage the project.
Did you know that a WES allows you to break down a seemingly overwhelming project into pieces
you can plan, organize, manage, and control? The creation of a WES is an eﬁort to decompose deliverables
into smaller component deliverables called work packages. Decomposition can be done using a top-down
approach (starting with the high-level pieces of a project), a bottom-up approach (starting at the work
package level), or by following organizational and industry guidelines or templates.
Note that on a WES, work refers not to an activity, but to the work pro ducts or deliverables that result
from an activity or group of activities. So, for the exam, note that each work package should consist of
nouns—things (deliverables) , rather than actions (activities). AWES is deliverable-oriented. This does not
mean that only customer deliverables are included. The complete scope of a project, including product
scope, project scope, and project management efforts are included as well.
Every WES is unique, and every project manager will approach creating a WES in their own way. But
there are a few guidelines that every project manager should follow when creating a WES:
' A WES should be created by the project manager using input from the team and other stakeholders.
' Each level of a W’ES is a breakdown of the previous level.
' An entire project should be included in the highest levels of a WES. Eventually, some levels will be
further broken down.
' A‘WES includes only project deliverables that are required , deliverables not included in the WES are
not part of the project.
During planning, the project management team and subject matter experts break down the scope
description until the work package level is reached. This occurs when the deliverables:
' Can be realistically and conﬁdently estimated (including the activities, duration, and cost associated
with them)
' Can be completed quickly
' Can be completed without interruption and without the need for more information
' May be outsourced
At this point, you might enter the work packages—the items at the lowest level of the WES—into
some sort of project scheduling software. You would not try to ﬁnalize the list of work packages by using
software, however. That list comes from the creation of the WES.

The levels in the WES are often numbered for ease of location later. When the WES is complete,
identiﬁcation numbers are assigned to help distinguish where a work package is in the WES. There are
many different numbering systems you can use. Figure 5.8 provides an example.

Work packages
FIGURE 5.3 Sample WES numbering system
You may see the terms r"control account”13 or “planning package” on the exam. Sometimes found at
higher levels within the WES (as shown in ﬁgure 5.8), a control account is a tool that allows you to collect
and analyze work performance data regarding costs, schedule, and scope. Control accounts, which may
include one or more planning packages, provide a way to manage and control costs, schedule, and scope at
a higher level than the work package. Each work package in the WES is assigned to only one control account.
As planning progresses, the team breaks down the work packages from the WES into the schedule
activities (or “activities,” for short) that are required to produce the work packages. Note that this further
breakdown of the WES into an activity list is done as part of the schedule management process of Deﬁne
Activities. The team uses the project scope statement, WES, and WES dictionary (described later in this
chapter) to help deﬁne which activities are required to produce the deliverables.
For example, on small projects, the WES is often broken down into work packages that take between
4 and 40 hours to complete. Medium-sized projects may have work packages with 8 to 80 hours of work.
On large projects, however, the work packages may be much larger and could involve 300 hours of work.
Therefore, the Deﬁne Activities process is especially important on large projects. Think about how this
effort is different on a large project than on a small project.
If your company works on many similar projects, it is important to realize that the WES from one
project may be used as the basis for another. Therefore, the project management oiﬁce should collect and
share WES examples and encourage the creation of templates. Project WESs become part of the company’s
organizational process assets, and may be used by similar projects in the future.
Great project managers not only see the value of the information provided in the 1WES, they also
recognize the value of the effort involved in creating the WES. Do you really understand what a MS is?
Try the next exercise. If you miss many of the answers, review this section, and rethink your knowledge
before taking the exam.
5.3 EXBI'ClSB Test yourself! What are the beneﬁts of using a WES? Write the answer in your
Exercise Notebook.

F I V E
Answer The following are beneﬁts of using a WES:
' Helps prevent work from slipping through the cracks
I Provides project team members with an understanding of how deliverables ﬁt into the overall
project management plan and gives the project team an indication of the impact of their work
on the project as a whole
' Facilitates communication and cooperation between and among the project team and
other stakeholders
' Helps manage stakeholder expectations regarding deliverables
' Helps identify risks
' Helps prevent changes
' Focuses the project team’s experience on what needs to be done, resulting in increased quality
and a project that is easier to manage
' Provides a basis for estimating resources, costs, and schedules
' Provides proof of the need for resources, funds, and schedules
'- Helps with planning control eﬁbrts and establishing acceptance criteria for deliverables
' Gets team buy-in and builds the project team
' Helps people better understand the project
A W’BS is the foundation of a project. Tais means almost everything that occurs in planning after the
creation of a “7138 is related to the WES. For example, project costs and schedules are estimated at the work
package or activity level, and not for the project as awhole. Also note that aWBS can help a project manager
identify more risks by examining a project at the work package level. Work packages are assigned to
individuals or parts of the performing organization, depending on the size of the project. Do the
relationships shown in ﬁgure 5.9 make sense to you?

Let’s think about the project control element in ﬁgure 5.9. Many people forget to use the project
management tools from project planning while the work is being done. They may create a WBS just because
it is a required part of a complete scope baseline, but then forget about it. As a result, they do not get the full

5.4 EXBTClSB What do you do with a WES once it has been created?
If you were going to test someone’s WES knowledge, would you ask questions about the basics of
creating a WES, or would you test their knowledge by asking how a WES can help a project man-
ager to better manage a project? The exam strongly weighs toward the latter. So, take some time to
really think about this question and write the answer in your Exercise Notebook.
Answer When completed, the W’ES can be used any time the scope of a project needs to be
reevaluated. For example:
' When there is a scope-related change request, a project manager can use the “ES, along with
the project scope statement, to determine if the request is within the planned scope of
the project.
i A project manager can use the WES as part of the integrated change control process to
evaluate impacts of changes that relate to scope.
' Project managers can control scope creep14 by using the WES to reinforce what work is to be
done. (The term “scope creep" refers to scope increasing or varying from what was planned.)
'
The WES can be used as a communications tool when discussing the project with the team or
the customer.
' The WES can be used to help new team members see their roles on the project.

WBS Dictionary
Think about how a work package is identiﬁed in a WES. It is usually described using
only one or two words. But assigning a deliverable with such a brief description to a team member allows
for too much possible variation. In other words, it allows for scope creep. A WES dictionary is the solution
to this problem. This document provides a description of the work to be done for each WES work package,
and it lists the acceptance criteria for each deliverable, which ensures the resulting work matches what is
needed. Therefore, a project manager can use a WES dictionary to prevent scope creep before work even
starts, rather than dealing with scope creep while the work is being clone.
154

F l  v E
Scope
The “WES dictionary is an output of the Create WES process. This document may be used as part of a
work authorization system, which informs team members when their work package is going to start. A
WBS dictionary can include descriptions of schedule milestones, acceptance criteria, durations,
interdependencies, and other information about work packages. You can also use it to control what work is
done when, to prevent scope creep, and to solidify a stakeholder’s understanding of the eﬁbrt required for
each work package. The MS dictionary essentially puts boundaries around what is included in a work
package, similar to the way the project scope statement puts boundaries around what is included in a
project. Note that some of the entries in a WES dictionary, such as durations and interdependencies, may
be ﬁlled in during iterations, rather than when it is ﬁrst drafted.
AWBS dictionary may look similar to the example shown in ﬁgure 5.10.

SCOPE Baseline
As discussed in the “Integration” chapter, baselines help the project manager control
their projects. Baselines are simply the ﬁnal and approved versions of certain pieces of the project manage-
ment plan. For scope, the baseline is made up of the ﬁnal versions of the WBS, the WBS dictionary, and the
project scope statement that are approved at the end of planning, before the project work begins. As the
work on the project is being done, the project manager reviews how the project is progressing and compares
that data to the baseline by answering the following questions:
' How is my project going, and how does that compare to the baseline?
' What scope has been completed on the project?
' Does it match what is deﬁned in the WES, 1WES dictionary, and project scope statement?
If scope is needed that is not in the baseline, a change has to be formally approved through the inte-
grated change control process, and a new item (or items) needs to be added to the WES, W5 dictionary,
and project scope statement to show the scope addition. This updated documentation becomes the new
scope baseline for the project. Any other components of the project management plan and project docu-
ments that are affected by the change in scope also need to be updated, including requirements documenta-
tion and the assumption log.
Measurements of success include whether the project has met all the requirements, including the
scope baseline. Because a project manages performance is evaluated along with the success of the project,
it is essential to use the tools, techniques, and practices of project management in the real world. These
assets make it so much easier to achieve success on a project and to get a great evaluation of your own
performance as the project manager.
Validate and Control Scope
mamas
Many people are confused about what it means to validate scope. If you correctly understand scope control
and validation from the perspective of the PMBOK'E’ Guide, you can get more questions right on the exam.
These next few pages will clarify the process of validating scope along with the process of controlling scope,
and will help you ﬁnd gaps in your knowledge.
OF THE
Scope means conﬁrming the validity and appropriateness of the scope deﬁnition during project
TRADE
planning. This is incorrect, however. The Validate Scope process actually involves frequent,
planned meetings with the customer or sponsor to gain formal acceptance of deliverables during project
monitoring and controlling. That’s a big difference, isn’t it?
| TRICKS
First, think about the name of the process: scope validation. Many people think Validate
Let’s look at the inputs to this process. Try this exercise.
5.5 Exercise In your Exercise Notebook, can you list “what do I need before I can” validate
scope? (The inputs of Validate Scope.)
Answer
' Work must be completed and checked before each meeting with the customer; therefore, you
must have what are called veriﬁed deliverables from the Control Quality process.
I It’s helpful to have the approved scope with you when you meet with the customer, so you
need the scope baseline from the project management plan.
' You’ll also need to share information about the requirements of the project and show the
customer how those requirements have been validated. ”1-:1is information can be found in the
requirements management plan and the requirements traceability matrix.

F I V E
' In addition, you should have the requirements documentation with you, in order to compare
the requirements to actual results. You can then determine whether any action or change
needs to take place.
' Other project documents, such as quality reports and lessons learned, should also be reviewed
at the start of this process. Quality reports can include information about open or closed
issues as well as issue management, while lessons learned can be used to improve the process
of validating project deliverables.
' Another component you should have from the project management plan is the scope
management plan, which shows the previously agreed—up on deliverables and plans for gaining
formal acceptance for them.
' Lastly, you will need to refer to work performance data from the Direct and Manage Project
Work process to assess how well product deliverables are meeting the requirements.
Whenever you think about the inputs of a project management process, make sure you can
describe them and explain where they come from and what they can oﬂer. Similarly, make sure
you understand how outputs ﬂow logically from each process. For the exam, this deeper understanding
will often give you more insight into situational questions, help you distinguish between relevant and
extraneous data, and help you select the correct answers.
TRICKS
Did you notice that we didn’t just list the inputs, but actually described how they will be used?
UFTHE
TRADE”
Now let’s try outputs (outcomes).
5.5 Exercise In your Exercise Notebook, list what you’ll have when you’re done with the Validate
Scope process. (The outcomes or outputs of Validate Scope.)
Answer Another way of lo oking at an output is to think about why you are doing this and what the
expected result is. Validate Scope is done to help ensure the project is on track from the customer’s
point of view during the project, rather than just hoping to get ﬁnal acceptance in project closure. It
is better to ﬁnd changes and issues during the project than at the end. The customer will either
accept deliverables or make change requests. In either case, the project documents will need to be
updated to reﬂect completion or changes. Therefore, the outputs are:
' Updates to project documents
I‘ Work performance information (analyzed work performance data)
' Accepted deliverables
' Change requests
Scope process. First, it can be done at the end of each project phase in the project life cycle (to
get formal acceptance of the phase deliverables along the way) and at other points throughout
the project as part of monitoring and controlling (to get formal acceptance of any deliverables that require
approval in the middle of the phase or project). Therefore, you validate scope with the customer multiple
times throughout the life of a project. In a change-driven project, this will happen at the end of each
iteration as part of the iteration review with the customer. Second, the difference between the Validate
Scope and the Close Project or Phase processes can also be a little tricky. Whereas the Validate Scope
process results in formal acceptance by the customer of interim deliverables, part of the reason for the
Close Project or Phase process is to get ﬁnal acceptance or sign-off from the customer for the project or
phase as a whole. The third tricky aspect is understanding how Validate Scope relates to the Control
Quality process. See the high-level diagram in ﬁgure 5.11.

Relationship bemeen Validate Scope and Central Quality
Although Control Quality is generally done ﬁrst (to make sure the deliverable meets the requirements
before it is shown to the customer), the two processes are very similar as both involve checking for the
correctness of work. The diﬁbrence is the focus of the effort and who is doing the checking. In Control
Quality, the quality control department checks to see if the requirements speciﬁed for the deliverables are
met and makes sure the work is correct. In Validate Scope, the customer checks and hopefully accepts
the deliverables.
Many project managers do not really control their projects. If this is true for you, you might have some
gaps in your knowledge. The Control Scope process involves measuring and assessing work performance
data against the scope baseline and managing scope baseline changes. At any point in a project, the project
manager must be sure that the scope is being completed according to the project management plan. As you
take the exam, assume that the project manager is controlling scope in this way. Assume proper project
management is being done on the project unless the question states otherwise.
To control scope, you ﬁrst need to have a clear deﬁnition of the scope (the scope baseline from the
project management plan), and you need to have work completed on the project. You also need to be aware
of the original requirements recorded in the requirements documentation and the requirements traceability
matrix (inputs to this process). You then have to measure the completed work against the scope baseline,
perform data analysis, including analyzing any variances, and determine whether the variances are
signiﬁcant enough to warrant changes. If necessary, you would submit a change request through the
Perform Integrated Change Control process to assess the impact the change would have on all aspects of
the project. New work performance information may result, along with updates to the project management
plan and project documents.
Remember that the Control Scope process is extremely proactive. It includes thinking about where
changes to scope are coming from on the project and what can be done to prevent or remove the need for
any more changes from that source. Properly using project management tools, techniques, and practices
will save you from unnecessary problems throughout the life of a project.
As a project manager, your job is not to just process other people’s changes; it is to control the project
to the project management plan and to meet all baselines. Therefore, you should not be easily swayed or
inﬂuenced, and you should not let others add scope or change scope without following the approved
change management process and without ensuring the suggested changes are within the planned scope of
the project. As discussed earlier, people who want work to be done will try to add it to the project whether
it is logically part of the project or not. So, you must control the project scope.

Explanation The project scope statement describes work on a high—level basis. Work packages need
to be speciﬁc to enable team members to complete their work without gold plating. The product
scope does not tell team members what work is assigned to them. The team should have a copy of the
schedule, but a schedule does not show them what work is included in each of their work packages.
Work packages are described in the WES dictionary. NOTE: Do not think of the WES dictionary as a
dictionary of terms.
Answer A
Explanation A user story is a way of stating a requirement, often using the following format: As a
{role}, I want {functionality/goal}, so that {business beneﬁt/motivation}. User stories may be
developed in facilitation sessions or as part of other requirements-gathering activities.
Answer C
Explanation Monitor Risks, Control Schedule, and Control Scope are monitoring and controlling
processes. This situation asks how to prevent the problem; which would have been done during
planning. The project deliverables are deﬁned in the Deﬁne Scope process, which is part of project
planning. Good planning reduces the likelihood of a situation like the one described in the question,
by including the right people and spending adequate time clarifying the project scope.
Answer A
Explanation Work breakdown structures are required on projects of every size, regardless of whether
contracts are involved. Work breakdown structures can be used to help identify risks , but risks can be
identiﬁed using other methods as well. Preventing work from being forgotten (slipping through the
cracks) is one of the main reasons the tool is used, and is the best choice oﬂered here.
Answer C
Explanation This scenario calls for a skilled facilitator to bring the authors together and guide them
to a consensus. Choosing the best design yourself would be outside the scope of your role as the
project manager, since the authors are responsible for the content. That would also contradict the
agile principle that collective decision-making is the best way to maximize value. Creating a context
diagram or a prototype wouldn’t be helpful in this scenario since those tools wouldn’t help the authors
come to a consensus about the course design.

Answer A
Explanation The scope baseline includes the W'BS, W'BS dictionary, and the project scope statement.
The scope management plan is not part of the scope baseline.
Answer B
Explanation Notice that there are many things the project manager could do listed in the choices,
however, the question asks what the project manager should do next. Management of the change is
not complete when the Control Scope process is completed. It is important to look at the impact of the
change on other parts of the project, such as schedule and budget. Therefore, performing integrated
change control is the best thing to do next. This would probably be followed by making sure the impact
of the change is understood by the stakeholder, then determining why this scope was not identiﬁed in
planning, and asking the stakeholder if more changes are expected.
Answer A
Explanation The project scope statement is an output of the Deﬁne Scope process. The work break—
down structure is an output of the Create WES process. Scope change requests are outputs of the
Validate Scope and Control Scope processes. The requirements traceability matrix is an output of the
Collect Requirements process, and is used to track the requirements throughout the life of the project.
Answer B
Explanation It might appear that none of the four answer options refer to the team’s solution design.
But in fact, a careful review of the early, incomplete increments provides the best opportunity for
stakeholders to shape the design of the solution. Since this is when the team is designing the rest of the
solution, the cost of change is quite low and the opportunity for influence is high. The team’s plans and
meetings usually won’t provide much opportunity for reviewing or influencing the solution design.
Finally, waiting for testable release-ready features will be by far the most costly and ine ”icient way to
review the design and suggest changes.
Answer A
Explanation Control Quality checks for correctness, and Validate Scope checks for acceptance.
Answer A
Explanation The Validate Scope process deals with acceptance by the customer. Without this
acceptance, the project manager will not be able to move into the next project phase.
Answer A
Explanation Much of the work on the project is dictated by the project scope statement. Any
imprecision in such a key document will lead to diﬁering interpretations.
Answer C
Explanation The project management plan is completed before the Validate Scope process. The
Validate Scope process does not deal with time, but rather with acceptance. The Validate Scope process
does not occur before the Deﬁne Scope process. The choice stating that the Validate Scope process
ensures customer acceptance, shows the deliverable meets speciﬁcations, and provides a chance for
differences of opinion to come to light is entirely correct, making that the best answer.
Answer B
Explanation Notice how the choices are similar to each other? Simply look at the ﬁrst part of each
choice "Control Scope focuses on . . .” and see which version of the ﬁrst part of the statement is correct.
Then read the second part of each choice. The only statement that is entirely correct is: Control
Scope focuses on controlling the scope of the project, and Perform Integrated Change Control
focuses on determining the impact of a change of scope on time, cost, quality, risk, resources, and
customer satisfaction.

## After some arguing between stakeholders, a new activity 6 is added to the project. It will take 1 1


weeks to complete and must be completed before activity 5 and after activity 3. Management is
concerned that adding the activity will add 1 1 weeks to the project. Another stakeholder argues
the time will be less than 11 weeks. Who is correct? Use the original information (without the
change to activity 3 listed in the previous question) to answer this question.

## Based on the information in question 6, how much longer will the project take?


Answer There are many ways to answer these questions. If you learned another way in your
project management training and are comfortable with that method, use it. Here is a simple way to
compute the answers.

## The length of the critical path is 18. There are two paths here:

Start, 1, 2; 4. 5, End (shown with the bold arrows in the diagram) is the longest duration
path and is therefore the critical path. The durations of the activities add up to 18, so the critical
path is 18 weeks long.

## The ﬂoat of activity 3 is 5 weeks, per the following diagram , which shows how to calculate ﬂoat


using the forward and backward pass.
Total length is 18 weeks

LS = Lets start
LF = Late finish
You can use either ﬂoat formula to compute ﬂoat. Late ﬁnish — Early ﬁnish = 14 — 9 = 5, or
Late start — Early start = 8 — 3 = S.

## The ﬂoat of activity 2 is zero; it is on the critical path. An activity on the critical path generally


has no ﬂoat.

## The ﬂoat of activity E is one month. Once you have ﬁnished calculating using the long way, all


the other answers are usually quick. Just look at the diagram to see the ﬂoat of any activity.
Watch out here for the ﬂoat of activity E. The project must be completed by the end of
month 33. Activity E must be completed before activities G, H, and C can start. So the late
ﬁnish forE is 33 —- 3 ~— 7 —~ 5, or 13.
ActivityE must be completed after activity D. So the early ﬁnish is 4 + 3, or 12.. Float = Late
ﬁnish - Early ﬁnish, so 13 - 12 = 1.
Float = Late ﬁnish - Early ﬁnish, so 13 — 12 = 1.

## The ﬂoat of activity D is one month.


Now let’s look at using a calculation to determine the ﬂoat for activity D. The project must
be completed by the end of month 33. Activity D must be completed before activities E, F, G,
H, C, and B can start. Looking backward through the dependencies, the late ﬁnish is
33 - 8 — 7 — 5, but then we run into a problem. Normally we would go along the critical path,
but look at activities E and F. Activity E is longer than activity F, so we must go along the longest
duration path, from activity G to activity E, making the late ﬁnish 33 - 3 — 7 - 5 — 8, or 5.
Early ﬁnish is easier. There are no predecessors, so the early ﬁnish is the end of month 4.
Float = S — 4, or 1 month.

## Removing the work of activity E will have no eﬂ'ect on the critical path. The paths are now:

The following are good questions to test your knowledge about critical paths, ﬂoat, and
OF THE
network diagrams:
TRADE-
Can there be more than one critical path? Yes, you can have two, three, or many critical paths.
Do you want there to be? No 5 having more than one critical path increases risk.
Can a critical path change? Yes.
Can there be negative ﬂoat? Yes 5 it means you are behind.
How much ﬂoat does the critical path have? In planning, the critical path generally has zero total
ﬂoat. During project executing, if an activity on the critical path is completed earlier or later than
planned, the critical path may then have positive or negative ﬂoat. Negative ﬂoat on the critical path
requires corrective action or changes to the project to bring it back in line with the plan.
Does the network diagram change when the end date changes? No, not automatically, but the
project manager should investigate schedule compression options such as fast tracking and crashing
the schedule to meet the new date. Then, with approved changes, the project manager should
change the network diagram accordingly.
Would you leave the project with negative ﬂoat? No; you would compress the schedule. Ifschedule
compression eﬂorts do not result in zero or positive ﬂoat, you need to request a change to adjust
the baseline.

It is easy to miss paths through a network diagram. When attempting to identify the critical path,
carefully calculate the duration of each path to ensure you look at all paths before determining which
is critical.
SCtUlB Compressionﬂ
One of the most common problems on projects is an unrealistic timeframe.
This problem can arise during project planning when management or the customer requires a completion
date that cannot be met, or during project executing when the project manager needs to bring the project
back in line with the schedule baseline or adjust the project for changes. As we discussed earlier, many
project managers blame their sponsors or executives for unrealistic schedules, but project managers have a

s I x
Schedule
professional responsibility to push back, present options, and make sure the project is achievable by
properly planning the project and using schedule network analysis techniques such as schedule compression.
Also keep in mind that schedule compression is a way to utilize flo at by fast tracking activities that are
on the critical path. This means adjusting the network diagram so critical path activities that were originally
planned to be completed in a series are replanned to be done in parallel. As we discuss next, fast tracking
can save time, but it also adds risk to the project.
During project planning, schedule compression can help a project manager determine if the desired
completion date can be met and, if not; what can be changed to meet the requested date.
Later in the projectJ schedule compression may be used during Perform Integrated Change Control
and Control Schedule to evaluate options to manage the impacts of changes. The objective of this technique
is to manage the schedule without changing the schedule baseline. This isn’t always possible , but we try.
Fast Tracking This technique involves taking critical path activities that were originally planned to be
done one after another and doing them instead in parallel for some or all of their duration, as shown in
ﬁgure 6.14. Fast tracking often results in rework, usually increases risk, and requires more attention
to communication.

FIGURE 6.15
Which activity would yeufast track?
Assuming the dependencies are discretionary. activity H could be fast tracked by making it occur at
the same time as, or in parallel with, activity G. Any other pair of activities on the critical path could be fast
tracked. Activities C and H could also be fast tracked by having part of activity C done concurrently with
activity I-I.
Let’s take a look at a real-world scenario with fast tracking. A cable TV provider was using a hybrid
project approach to implement web analytics tools. The project team was asked to fast track their project to
be ready for a large marketing push in response to a competitor’s campaign. The product owner met with
the steering committee and reviewed the release roadmap and product backlog. They identiﬁed scope that
could be deferred until after initial launch, allowing the bulk of the functionality to be delivered on time to
track the new promotion. The customer could create some reports on their own in spreadsheets rather than
relying on the tool, and some metrics could be eliminated from scope or deferred. However, the core data
and decision-making frameworks would be delivered on time if the steering committee understood and
approved the workarounds and reduced functionality. Once the necessary approval was given, the project
proceeded and was largely ready on time. The team struggled some when analyzing data via spreadsheets
rather than reports} but the project was able to fast track most of the business value in time for the marketing
campaign. A future release of the project completed the functionality and retired the analysis spreadsheets.

As you can see, fast tracking added some risk to the project and reduced initial functionality of the
product, but it was an effective way for the project manager to meet the new, shorter schedule requirement.
Crashing“ This technique involves adding or adjusting resources in order to compress the schedule while
maintaining the original project scope. Crashing, by deﬁnition, always results in increased costs, and may
increase risk. It trades time for money.
For example, in the netwnrk diagram in ﬁgure 6.15 , a contract resource could supplement the internal
resource’s efforts on a critical path activity (assuming this is logical, based on the nature of the work).
Another option to crash the project might be to buy a software application, the purchase adds cost to the
project but helps the team work more e "lciently, thus saving time.
If you have negative project ﬂoat (meaning the estimated completion date is after the desired date),
would your ﬁrst choice be to tell the customer the date cannot be met and to ask for more time? No ; the
ﬁrst choice would be to analyze what could be done about the negative ﬂoat by compressing the schedule.
In crashing or fast tracking, it is best to see all potential choices and then select the option or options that
have the least negative impact on the project. For the exam, remember that you need to identify all the
possible options and, if given a choice between crashing or fast tracking options, select the choice or
combination of choices with the least negative impact on the project. This tip can help you on exam
questions that seem to have two right answers.
In the real world, many project managers use the network diagram to manage the day-to—day operations
of the project and to make adjustments when changes occur. You should expect this to be reﬂected on the
exam in terms of the numb er of questions involving network diagrams, calculations, and “What do you do
in this situation?” scenarios.
Let’s make sure you are prepared to deal with unrealistic schedules on the exam. This issue is so
important that you can expect to see more than 10 questions about it. Most project managers have some
gaps in their knowledge in this area, and it shows on their score sheets. To remedy this, let’s review a
scenario (described next) and see if the explanations make sense to you.
Figure 6.15 shows that the project duration is estimated to be 33 months. But what if you’re given a
constraint of 30 months? Options are listed in the following table to illustrate how the project duration can
be shortened by three months.

6.7 Exercise Consider the following question and write the answer in your Exercise Notebook:
Question
Management has told you to get the project completed two weeks early. What is the
best thing for you to do?
A. Consult the project sponsor
B. Crash
C. Fast track
D. Advise management of the impact of the change
Answer Did you get fooled by this question? Did you think you had to choose between crashing
and fast tracking? There is no information provided to help you determine which one is better.
Therefore, the best choice presented is D, advise management of the impact of the change.
The exam will include many such questions requiring you to know that a project manager
needs to analyze ﬁrst, create options to deal with the change, and then let management, the spon-
sor, the customer, or other parties know the impacts of their request (see the four—step process for
handling changes in the “Integration” chapter). A project manager does not just say yes! Instead,
after analyzing the change for its impact on all areas of the project (cost, risk, resources, etc), they
could say something like, “Yes, I would be happy to make the change, but the project will be delayed
two weeks. And I will need two more resources, or the project will cost $25,000 more.”

durations.

Data Analysis/Simulation
In creating a ﬁnalized, realistic schedule, it is helpful to ask, “What if a
particular factor changed on the project? Would that produce a shorter schedule?” The assumptions for
each activity can change and, therefore, the activity durations can also change. One of the ways to calculate
the effect of these changes is through what—if scenario analysis.
Monte Carlo Analysisls This technique uses computer software to simulate the outcome of a project,
based on the three-point estimates (optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely) for each activity and the
network diagram. The simulation can tell you:
' The probability of completing the project on any speciﬁc day
i The probability of completing the project for any specific cost
'
The probability of any activity actually being on the critical path
' An indication of the overall project risk
Monte Carlo analysis is another way of putting together the details of three—point estimates into a
project estimate. It is more accurate than other methods because it simulates the actual details of the project
and calculates probability.
Monte Carlo analysis can help deal with "path convergence,” places in the network diagram where
multiple paths converge into one or more activities, thus adding risk to the project (see ﬁgure 6.16). Monte
Carlo analysis is also used as a risk management tool to quantitatively analyze risks (see the "Risk” chapter).

Resource optimization refers to ﬁnding ways to adjust the use of resources.
There are two techniques that can achieve this outcome.
' Resource Leveling” Resource leveling is used to produce a resource-limited schedule. Leveling
lengthens the schedule and increases cost to deal with a limited number of resources, resource avail-
ability, and other resource constraints. A little-used function in project management software, this
technique allows you to level the peaks and valleys of the schedule from one month to another, result-
ing in a more stable number of resources used on your project.
You might level the resources if your project used 5 resources one month, 15 the next, and 3 the
next, or some other up—and—down pattern that was not acceptable. Leveling could also be used if you
did not have 1 5 resources available and preferred to lengthen the project (which is a result of leveling)
instead of hiring more resources.
' Resource Smoothing13 Resource smoothing is a modified form of resource leveling, where
resources are leveled only within the limits of the ﬂoat of their activities, so the completion dates of
activities are not delayed.
Velocityzg
Velocity is the measure of a team’s capacity for work for each iteration. This powerful metric
allows the team to gauge how much work they will be able to do in future iterations based on the amount
of work they completed in past iterations. This provides a way to track and communicate what they have
accomplished, anticipate what they will be able to accomplish in the future, and forecast when the project
(or release) is likely to be done.
Project performance metrics like velocity allow agile teams in particular to make fairly reliable
estimates about how long it will take them to complete work despite the changes to the project and scope.
On change-driven projects especially, velocity is used for estimating and planning upcoming releases and
iterations. Figure 6.17 is an example of tracking a team’s velocity across iterations.
Velocity usually varies the most in the ﬁrst few iterations when the team is getting used to working
together, interacting with project stakeholders, and using the project tools. This makes it a very powerful
tool for planning and estimating.

Iterations
Care needs to be taken when using velocity metrics outside of the team environment to avoid abuse
or gaming the metrics. For instance, organizations will sometimes try to compare velocities of two or more
teams, but these comparisons are meaningless since each team deﬁnes their own units based on what is
meaningful and valuable to them. Another mistake some organizations make is incentivizing velocity,
which usually results in inﬂation of the points assigned to work rather than an increase in work done since
it is easier to pad estimates than work faster. Many agile experts today discourage the use of velocity because
of the negative affects it can have. However, velocity can still be a useful team metric if used internally
within the team. Teams need to be vigilant that conditions do not arise that could lead to its misuse.
Consider this scenario. A hybrid team is using story points to track their velocity on a rewrite of a
customer account management website. The team is using short iterations and demos to deliver functionality
in a largely predictive organization. After the steering committee learned the team was using story points
and velocity to track their progress, they focused on the weekly velocity ﬁgures.
If the points completed did not increase each week, the team was asked to explain. Consciously or
unconsciously, the team started to inﬂate their story-point estimates for work. That way, they would have
more points to report as complete each week. A screen that might have been originally estimated as three
points became ﬁve. However, the points were now meaningless to the team since they could not compare
current to past performance. Questions like “are these ﬁve new points or ﬁve old points?" became common
wastes of time.
To reset the process, the team used a ”inity estimation to compare and reset new stories with the point
value from previous stories of comparable size and complexity. Story point inﬂation was reversed, and
points became useful for the team once more. The project manager explained the situation to the steering
committee, who agreed not to overtly track and inquire about velocity—although they continued to do so
in private.
Agile RBIBHSB Planning
Agile projects are often divided into releases and iterations. An iteration is a
short, timeboxed development period, typically one to four weeks in duration. A release is a group of
iterations that results in the completion of a valuable deliverable on the project. An agile project will have
one or more releases, each of which will contain one or more iterations, as illustrated in ﬁgure 6.18.

This diagram shows a single project with two releases to production. The ﬁrst release contains eleven
iterations, and the second contains ﬁve iterations. Agile teams start planning releases and iterations early in
the project life cycle and progressively reﬁne the planning effort multiple times as the project progresses.
Do you remember our discussion on the backlog and product roadmap in the "Scope” chapter? While
the backlog and the product roadmap help identify and manage project scope, they are also valuable tools
that help develop and manage the project schedule.
On agile projects, teams select from the top-priority backlog items to come up with their next iteration
goal. Then, they decompose the iteration goal into user stories to get the iteration plan. Planning continues
by decomposing those user stories into tasks. While the work is being done, the team discusses the details
of the work in the daily stand-up meetings.
Cumulative Flow Diagramsaﬂ Cumulative ﬂow diagrams (CFDs) are valuable tools for tracking and
forecasting the delivery of value. They can help us gain insight into project issues, cycle times, and likely
completion dates. Basically, CFDs are stacked area graphs that depict the features that are in progress,
remaining, and completed over time. An example of a CFD is illustrated in ﬁgure 6.19.

Outputs Of Developing the SCtUlB
The Develop Schedule process results in the project schedule,
the schedule baseline, schedule data, change requests, and updates to any related project documents. The
following sections describe these outputs.
Project Schedule The project schedule is the result of the previous planning processes and the schedule
network analysis that is performed as part of the Develop Schedule process. As planning progresses, the
schedule will be iterated in response to risk management and other parts of project planning until an
acceptable and realistic schedule can be agreed upon. The iterated and realistic schedule that results from
this eﬁort is called the schedule baseline, which becomes part of the project management plan.

about them before. The different types of schedule presentations can be one of those areas. Think through

Exercise Test yourself! In your Exercise Notebook, record the answers to the
following questions.

## Under what circumstances would you use a bar chart?


Answer

## To track progress 5 to report to the team


Schedule Baseline The schedule baseline is the version of the schedule model used to manage the project,
it is what the project team’s performance is measured against. Remember that the baseline can only be
changed as a result of formally approved changes. Meeting the schedule baseline is one of the measures of
project success. If the project can be done faster than the customer requested, there may be a difference
between the schedule baseline and the end date required by the customer. This difference is project ﬂoat.
Schedule Data Schedule data encompasses all the data used to create the schedule model, including
milestones, project activities, activity attributes, duration estimates, dependencies, and the assumptions
and constraints used in creating the schedule.
Change Requests This is another planning process with change requests as an output. As the project
progresses, any changes to the schedule may necessitate changes to other parts of the project management
plan. Change requests are addressed through the integrated change control process.
Project Documents Updates The process of creating a ﬁnal and realistic schedule could result in updates
to project documents including duration estimates, resource requirements, activity attributes, risk register,
assumption log, and the lessons learned register.

Control the Project Schedule
PAGE 222
Controlling the project was discussed in the "Processes and Domains” chapter, and is an important part of
every knowledge area (scope, schedule, cost, quality, etc.). We will spend a little more time talking about it
here. Control means measure 5 you measure against the plan. You need to stay in control of your project and
know how it is performing compared to the plan. Do you do this on your projects? If not, pay particular
attention to the concept of monitoring and controlling in this chapter and throughout this book. Make sure
you understand that such actions are done as part of basic project management. When answering exam
questions, you need to assume proper project management was done unless the question states otherwise.
On properly managed projects, a project manager does not have to spend all their time dealing with
problems, because most of those problems were prevented through appropriate planning and risk
management. Project managers are measuring against the plan and taking action as needed to control
the project.
The project (and the project manager) will be unsuccessful if the schedule baseline—the end date
agreed to in planning and adjusted for approved changes—is not met. So monitoring and controlling
efforts go beyond measuring 3 they also involve taking corrective and preventive action over and over again
during the life of the project to keep the project in line with the plan. Do you do this? If not, why not?
Without such work, all the efforts in planning to create a realistic schedule could be wasted.
Schedule control also means looking for the things that are causing changes and inﬂuencing the
sources, or root causes, of the changes. For example, if there is one person or one piece of work causing a
lot of changes, the project manager must do something about it, rather than let the issues and the high
number of changes continue. A project manager must be proactive.
If the project can no longer meet the agreeduupon completion date, and achieving the completion
date is a critical factor for success of the project, the project manager might recommend the termination of
the project before any more company time is wasted. In other words, the project manager might have to
inﬂuence directors and senior executives in the organization to control the project. Schedule control is
more than just issuing updated schedules!
Make sure you really understand what is involved in schedule control. Think of protecting the hard
work of all those involved in planning to make sure what was planned occurs as close to the plan as possible.
Think of being constantly on the lookout for anything that might be affecting the schedule. This is what it
means to control the schedule, and the project.
The following are some additional activities that can be used to control the schedule:
I Access the PMIS to review current work performance data and compare actual progress to what
was planned.
' Reestimate the remaining components of the project partway through the project (see the following
discussion).
' Conduct performance reviews by formally analyzing how the project is doing (see the "Earned Value
Measurement” discussion in the "Cost” chapter).
' Perform data analysis (this can include earned value analysis, trend analysis, variance analysis, and
what-if scenario analysis) of project performance.
' Conﬁrm that critical path activities are being completed within the schedule baseline. If they are not,
adjust the critical path by taking advantage of available ﬂoat.
' Adjust future parts of the project to deal with delays, rather than asking for a schedule extension
(using schedule compression techniques such as using leads and lags, crashing, and fast tracking).
' Consider making adjustments to optimize resources assigned to activities to improve the
performance.
' Continue eiforts to optimize the schedule.
' Adjust metrics that are not giving the project manager the information needed to properly understand
performance and manage the project. Add new metrics if needed.

Reestimating
One of the roles of a project manager is to make sure the project meets the project
objectives. Although you did your best to understand the project well enough to estimate it su ""iciently in
planning, there are always changes that occur during a project that impact those plans. Therefore, it is
standard practice to reestimate the remaining work at least once during the life of the project to make sure
you can still satisfy the project objectives within the schedule, budget, and other project constraints, and to
adjust the project if you cannot. Again, assume proper project management was done when answering
questions on the exam unless the question provides speciﬁc information to indicate it was not.
The Control Schedule process results in work performance information, schedule forecasts, and
sometimes change requests. For example, a change to the schedule might require additional resources or a
change in scope. Such changes must be handled as part of the Perform Integrated Change Control process.
Make sure you review this important process in the “Integration” chapter.
This process may also result in updates to the schedule management plan and performance
measurement baseline in addition to project documents such as the assumption log, risk register, and
lessons learned register, and changes to any other part of the project.

Answer C
Explanation A milestone represents the completion of a series of activities or work packages.
Milestones represent signiﬁcant events within the project schedule. They are not work activities, and
they have no duration.
Answer C
Explanation An estimate can have a wide range and still be accurate if the item estimated includes
identiﬁed risks. There is no such thing as a pad in proper project management. An estimate might be
inﬂated _. but it is a calculated reserve to account for risks, not arbitrary padding. The standard deviation
tells you the amount of uncertainty or risk involved in the estimate for the activity.
Answer C
Explanation Both types of charts are used in project planning. Team members need to see details,
so they need a bar chart rather than a milestone chart. Risk analysis could make use of both charts.
A milestone chart is used instead of a bar chart for any situation where you want to report in a less
detailed way. Since bar charts can intimidate people with their complexity— and often show too much
detail to be worthwhile on a management level—milestone charts are more effective for reporting
to management.
Answer B
Explanation Although having three critical paths could require more people or cost more, the answer
that is always true is that it increases project risk. Because you need to manage three critical paths,
there is more risk that something could happen to delay the project.
Answer C
Explanation East tracking affects both time and cost but may not help even out resource usage.
Monte Carlo analysis and analysis of life cycle costs do not directly deal with resources. Resource
optimization is the only choice that will deﬁnitely ailect resources.
Answer C
Explanation Leveling resources generally extends the schedule. Monte Carlo analysis does not
directly address the constraints of this situation. To compress the schedule, you could either crash or
fast track. However, the situation says that the network diagram cannot change. This eliminates fast
tracking , which leaves crashing the project as the best answer.
Answer D
Explanation This question tests whether you know how to solve problems. Cutting product scope
negatively affects the customer, and is therefore not best. A project manager’s job is to determine
options for meeting any end date; therefore, simply telling management the required date cannot be
met is not correct. Working overtime is expensive and unnecessary when there are many other choices
that could be considered ﬁrst. Determining options for schedule compression would have the least
negative effect on the project.
Answer C
Explanation This is another question that asks about problem-solving. Neither telling your manager
nor waiting to see the status next month will address the real problem. It would be inaccurate to
report that the project cannot be ﬁnished earlier. Only meeting with the team to look for options for
compressing the schedule (by crashing or fast tracking) relates to problem-solving.
Answer A
Explanation You may or may not need your customer’s or your sponsor’s input, but you will deﬁnitely
need to include an analysis of risk.

Answer B
Explanation Agile developers do indeed plan when the work will be ﬁnished, since time is typically
a critical (and ﬁxed) constraint on change-driven projects. However, there is usually too much
uncertainty to prepare a detailed schedule model upfront. Instead, the team can use t-shirt sizing to
create quick, coarseugrained estimates—this provides “just enough” planning to get started on the
work. So this is the correct answer. While many people have the impression that agile teams don’t do
much planning, in fact the opposite is true—an agile approach means the team is constantly planning
throughout the project. They just don’t do as much planning upfront. This iterative approach means
that most agile teams never create a formal schedule model, because it is likely to be outdated almost
as soon as it is done. Instead, they use easily updated planning tools such as burn charts, task boards,
and release maps.
Answer B
Explanation Time estimates for the activities should be created by the team and should not be added
together to create the project estimate. Some activities may take place concurrently; these would be
identiﬁed in the network diagram.
Answer A
Explanation The question implies a ﬁnish—to—ﬁnish relationship between activities. The arrow
diagramming method is not a commonly used diagramming method, and it does not support that type
of relationship. Critical path is not a diagramming method, and operational diagramming method is a
made-up term. The precedence diagramming method is most appropriate in this case.
Answer B
Explanation A heuristic is a general rule that can be used consistently. This situation is a unique
occurrence in which a preferred method is being suggested. Dependencies are often described with
two terms, either mandatory or discretionary, and either internal or external. The input in this scenario
is discretionary, as it is a suggestion, rather than a required method of doing the work. Since the input
comes from a source outside the organization, it is considered external.
Answer D
Explanation This is an example of a two—stage question you may ﬁnd on the exam. First you need to
draw the network diagram and ﬁnd the critical path, and then make a decision. The network diagram
would be:

The critical path is 16 (Start, C, E, H, End). Many people immediately look for the longest duration
activity on the project to cut. Here activity D is the longest, at 10 weeks. However, that activity is not on
the critical path, and cutting it would not shorten the project’s duration. You must change the critical
path. In this case, both activity C and activity H are on the critical path. If you have a choice, all things
being equal, cheese the earlier option. Therefore, activity C is the best answer.

## Answer D
### Answer D

Explanation There is no information presented about lag or progress. The activity described has float
because there is a difference between the early start and late start. An activity that has ﬂoat is probably
not on the critical path.

## Answer B
### Answer A

Explanation There is no need to be concerned with these results. The velocity data shows a lot of
variation over the ﬁrst ﬁve sprints, followed by emerging stability over the next three sprints. This is a
typical pattern for an agile team at the start of a project, and nothing to be worried about. (For such a
long project, this team’s velocity actually seems to be stabilizing quickly.) The fact that velocity has been
lower for the last four sprints isn’t relevant ; the atypical data points are actually the higher numbers
during sprints l and 3. While velocity is primarily used to track effort, it can also show performance
trends that need to be addressed. Although that doesn’t seem to be an issue in this scenario, it’s
incorrect to say that velocity can’t be used to evaluate performance. Agile teams don’t require stable
velocity numbers to begin planning. During upfront planning they estimate their initial velocity, and
then as the work continues they adjust their plans based on their track record to date.

In this example, you are looking for the value of the work that has actually been done. The
ﬁnish-to-ﬁnish relationship allowed the team to work on more than one side at the same time. In
this case, work is being done on both sides 3 and 4 at the same time. Since the value of each side is
$1,000, we look at how much of each side is complete and apply that percent to the value. Here
sides 1 and 2 are completed, so each receives a value of $1,000. It doesn’t matter what it actually
cost—just the value. Side 3 is 50 percent done and receives a value of $500 ( 50 percent of $ 1,000).
Side 4 is 75 percent done and receives a value of $750 (75 percent of $1 ,000). The earned value to
date is $3,250.
Understanding the meaning of the results of each calculation is as important as knowing how to
calculate them.
Expect questions on the exam such as: “The CPI is 0.9, and the SP1 is 0.92. What should you do?” You
will need to interpret this and other data in the question and then determine which choice would address
the issue (s) described. In the fence example, there are both cost and schedule problems.
You may also see questions on the exam that require you to perform multiple calculations (for example,
you need to perform one calculation to come up with a result that can be used as an input for a second
calculation). We have a few exercises coming up that will help you understand how to answer these
questions, but it’s helpful to ﬁrst consider the following useful tip.
TRICKS
Here’s a quick trick for ﬁnding EV when a question provides partial information. Depending
OF THE
on the information you’re given in a question, you can reverse the formulas you know for CV,
TRADE
SV, CPI, or SPI so you can isolate EV on its own side of the equation, which will make it much
easier to solve. For example, say a question gives you CV and AC and asks you to solve for EV.
You already know that CV = EV —— AC, so now you can reverse this formula by adding AC to both sides of
the equation as follows:
CV=EV—AC
C V + A C = E V — A C + A C
CV+AC=EV

s a v e s
De yeu understand why we added AC to beth sides ef the equatien? Yeu’re trying te iselate EV en
ene side ef the equatien. By adding AC tn the right side ef the eqnatien, yen cancel eut the —AC, se yen
end up with EV en its ewn. But whatever yen de en the right-hand side ef the equatien, yen have te de
en the left-hand side as well. (Here’s a little algebra refresher: yen can perferm an eperatien—such as
adding, subtracting, dividing, er multiplying—en ene side ef the equatien se leng as yen de the exact
same thing en the ether side as well. This allews yen te manipulate an equatien te make it easier te selve.)
Se new, te selve fer EV, all yeu have te de is add CV and AC.
Similarly, say a qnestien gives yen CPI and AC and asks yen te determine EV. Yen already knew the
fermnla fer CPI (CPI = EVXAC), but hew can yen iselate EV en ene side ef the equatien? Instead ef
adding AC te both sides ef the equatien, in this case, yen weuld multiply beth sides by AC:

CPI = —

CPI XAC = — XAC

reverse fermula would you use? Write the answer in yeur Exercise Netebeek.
Answer Since the questien gives us the CPI and AC, we can reverse the CPI fermula to get te the
EV. Se the reverse fermnla weuld be EV = CPI x AC, er EV = 1.1 X $10,000, which werks eut te
$ 1 1,000. Fer this questien, there was ne need te use the SPI infermatien.

Write the answer in yeur Exercise Netebeek.
Answer Te ﬁnd the SP1, yen actually need te perferm twe calculatiens here. The fermula fer SPI
is SPI = EV/PV; we knew what the PV is, but we den’t knew the EV. Luckily, we can ﬁgure it eut
using the infermatien given in the question. We’re given the SV and PV, se we can use the fellewing
reverse fermula te determine EV.

S E V E N
EV = SV + PV
EV = —$3,000 + $100,000
EV = $97,000
We can then plug the PV and EV into the SP1 formula as follows.

SPI = —
PV
$97,000
SP1 =
$100,000
SPI = .97
If your equation requires yeu to solve for something ether than EV (for example, AC or PV),
the math will be slightlyr more complicated, but don’t worry: we’ve got an exercise to help you
understand what to do.
7.7 Exercise Using the information from the previous exercise, determine AC. Write the answer
in your Exercise Notebook.
Answer We need to leek at the information from the previous exercise to determine what formula
to use to ﬁgure out AC. We knew the CV is $10,000 and the EV is $97,000 (from the calculation we
performed in the previous exercise). With this information, we can determine the AC by using the
formula CV = EV — AC. To do this, we ﬁrst plug the information we know into the formula:
CV = EV - AC
$10,000 = $97,000 - AC
To solve for AC, we need to get AC alone on one side of the equation. First, add AC to both
sides of the equation:
$10,000 + AC = $97,000 — AC + AC
$10,000 + AC = $97,000
The —AC and +AC on the right-hand side of the equation canceled each other out. But we still
need to isolate AC on the left-hand side of the equation. To do this, we’re going to subtract $10,000
from both sides.
$10,000 + AC - $10,000 = $97,000 — $10,000
AC = $87,000
7.3 EXBrClSB In the latest earned value report for your project, you see the CPI is 1.2, the SP1 is
0.8, the PV is $600,000, and the SV is —$120,000. You can’t ﬁnd the CV in the report, so you need
to calculate it based on the information given. What is the CV? Write the answer in your
Exercise Notebook.

S E V E N
Answer The formula for CV is CV = EV — AC. Therefore, we need to ﬁnd EV and AC to calculate
CV. We can do this by using one of the reverse formulas we learned earlier. Since we know the
values for SP1 (0.8) and PV ($600,000), we can use EV = SP1 X PV (this is the reverse formula for
SP1 = EV/PV).
EV = SP1}: 13v
av = 0.3 x $600,000
EV = $430,000
Now we need AC, which we can get from the EV we just determined and the CPI given in the
question (1.2).
The formula is CPI = EV
or 1.2 = aW—J'OOU .
AC
AC
We need to isolate AC on one side of the equation to ﬁgure out what it is. Start by multiplying
both sides of the equation by AC.
$430,000 X
AC
1.2 x AC =
AC.
The resulting equation is:
1.2 X AC = $430,000
To get AC on its own, we need to divide both sides by 1.2.
(1.2 x ac) _ $430,000
1.2
1.2
The resulting equation is:
$480,000
AC =
1.2
So, AC = $400,000.
Now that we know the EV and the AC, we can ﬁgure out what the CV is:
CV = EV - AC
cv = $430,000 — $400,000
CV = $80,000
In summary, earned value analysis enables the project manager and team to identifyr and analyze
trends in performance and variances that may require action to bring the project in line with what was
planned. It also includes monitoring the use of contingency reserves to ensure the amount of reserves
remaining is adequate. It may identify the need to request additional reserve funds through integrated
change control.
The Control Costs process provides measurements that indicate how the work is progressing and
allow the project manager to create reliable forecasts and take action to control the project. This process
may result in requested changes to the cost management plan, performance measurement baseline, and
other parts of the project management plan, recommended corrective or preventive actions, and updates to
project documents.

GDId Plating‘
Do you remember a time on a project when one of your team members delivered more
than what was needed? Can you think of a time when you’ve had trouble keeping a project from producing
the Taj Mahal when all you needed was a garage, for example? Geld plating refers to giving the customer
extras (extra functionality, higher-quality components, extra scep e, or better performance). Gold plating is
often the team’s impression of what is valued by the customer, and the customer might not agree. Since
most projects have di "l culty meeting the project objectives, all available eﬁert should go into achieving
these objectives, instead of into gold plating.
Sometimes gold plating is not planned, but rather arises out of a team members efforts to do their
best. The project manager must be on the lookout for team members providing more than is required for
the project.
Prevention DVBI‘ Inspection Is it better to inspect work to ﬁnd problems or to prevent them in the ﬁrst
place? Which takes less effort and is less costly? Remember that quality must be planned in, not inspected
in! The concept of prevention over inspection was advocated by quality theorist Philip Crosby. You may see
exam questions that test your understanding that failure to plan quality into a project will lead to problems
later in the project.

the quality of work, processes, and results. Within an organization it can include analysis of how quality
management is planned and utilized on projects. There are several approaches to continuous improvement
relevant to the ezam.
' Kaizen2 The terms “continuous improvement” and “Kaizen” are taken to mean the same thing on the
exam; however, in Japan, Kaizen means to alter (kai) and make better or improve (zen). Kaizen is a
general term, while continuous improvement is a quality movement. In the United States and most of
Western Europe, continuous improvement focuses on major improvements. In Japan, the emphasis is
on smaller improvements.
' Total Quality Management (TCLM)3 TQM encourages companies and their employees to focus on
ﬁnding ways to continuously improve the quality of their products and their business practices at
every level of the organization.
' Six Sigma4 This is a methodology for achieving organizational process improvement and high levels
of correctness with extremely reduced variances. Sigma (another name for standard deviation) indi-
cates how much variance from the mean has been established as permissible in a process. The higher
the sigma, the fewer deviations (or less variance) in the process. The level of quality required by an
organization is usually represented by 3 or 6 sigma. You will not have to calculate standard deviation,
but will be required to understand that larger ranges represent more deviations (or more variance).
JUSl in Time (JIT)El JIT means having suppliers deliver resources just before they are needed, thus
decreasing inventory to nearly zero and decreasing unnecessary cost. A comp any using JIT must achieve a
high level of quality in their practices; otherwise, there will not be enough materials or equipment to meet
requirements because of waste and rework. AJIT system forces attention on quality as well as schedule.
Responsibility lﬂl‘ Quality
The project manager has the ultimate accountability for the quality of the
product of the project, although senior management is responsible for promoting an organizational
approach that supports quality efforts and team members must inspect their own work. This often includes
a quality department that determines quality management methodologies the project manager is required
to follow. Work should meet the project requirements, and testing should be done whenever appropriate
before submitting the work.
Quality problems on a project are typically attributable to the management environment and the
system in which the team works. Therefore, senior management is responsible for promoting an
organizational approach that supports quality efforts. This often includes a quality department that
determines quality management methodologies the project manager is required to follow.
Understanding the Differences between Plan, Manage, and Control Quality
One ofthe major
challenges people have while studying this topic is understanding the differences between Plan, Manage,
and Control Quality. Some of this confusion may be a result of differences between the ECO and the
PMBOKE' Guide.
Remember that the current ECO doesn’t have three distinct quality processes. Domain 2. task 7 states
that you plan and manage the quality of products and/ or deliverables. The PMBOK‘E Guide, however,
speciﬁes three quality processes:
' Plan Quality Management This process focuses on deﬁning quality for the project, the pro duct, and
project management, and planning how it will be achieved.
' Manage Quality The Manage Quality process is focused on how work is being done. Its purpose is
to ensure the team is following organizational standards, policies, and processes as planned to pro-
duce the project’s deliverables. The project manager also evaluates whether the quality management
plan or processes need to be improved.
' Control Quality Control Quality includes ezamining the actual deliverables produced on the proj—
ect to ensure they are correct and meet the planned level of quality, evaluating variances, ﬁnding the
source of problems, and recommending ways to address them.

Administration), and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for International Sale of Goods
(use)?
As an example, a construction company could establish a standardized practice for installations on
heme construction projects. Imagine all the installers within that organization putting together their best
ideas to improve the installation work on future projects. That would be a valuable effort that could improve
quality and safety while saving time and money.
InpUlS to Plan Quality Management
Organizational process assets can help identify relevant
standards, policies, and procedures and include lessons learned from previous projects. A project manager
may create additional project-speciﬁc standards and procedures that are needed on how quality is deﬁned
for each piece of work. For the exam, you should understand that this effort could also include deﬁning
processes for how project management activities should be done, and suggesting improvements to existing
processes.
The customer’s quality standards might be outlined in an agreement (contract) or need to be
discovered as part of the Collect Requirements process. Quality requirements are documented, analyzed,
and prioritized according to the requirements management plan. Examples of such standards are the
acceptable number of software bugs per module, the strength of concrete, or the average time per
installation. These measures of quality will later be used to manage and control quality.
Management plans and documentation that aid in quality planning include the stakeholder engage—
ment plan and stakeholder register, a list of the major project deliverables (requirements management
plan), risk thresholds (risk management plan), and approval requirements (project charter). The scope
baseline helps the project manager maintain the proper perspective and plan quality to the appropriate
level. The assumption log provides insight into the level of quality that is assumed to be acceptable on the
project. The requirements traceability matrix shows the origin of requirements related to quality and will
be used to conﬁrm that quality requirements, including external compliance requirements, have
been achieved.
Outcomes Of Plan Quality Management
Remember that the purpose of planning quality
management is to determine what quality is for a particular project and to create a plan to deliver that level
of quality. Most quality management plans include the standard practices already discussed, along with
who will help lead the quality management eifort, what their duties are and what processes they will follow.
Meetings to hold, reports and metrics that will be used are included, along with what parts of the project or
deliverables will be measured and at what intervals. Strategies for analysis and improvement of processes
and procedures are included in the quality management plan.
Throughout this book, there is an underlying theme that the project manager must know how the
project is performing compared to what was planned and be able to determine when to request changes.
The only way to effectively do this is to determine metrics in advance and (in most cases) decide what range
of variation is acceptable. The following are some examples of quality metrics:
' The number of changes (to help measure the quality of the project management planning process)
' The variance related to resources utilization
' The number of items that fail inspection
' The variance of the weight of a product produced by the project compared to the planned weight
' The number of bugs found in software that is being developed as part of the project
Planning quality management will also result in iterations of other project management artifacts. For
example, quality management work added to the project is documented in the scope baseline (WES and
WBS dictionary) as well as in the requirements traceability matrix, and may necessitate adjustments to the
project activity list, schedule, budget, and resource assignments. Risks related to quality may be added to
the risk register, and risk management added to the project management plan.
Quality

E I G H T
Although a project manager and the team must be involved and concerned about quality control, a
quality department may complete much of this work in large companies. The department then informs the
project manager about quality issues through change requests, which are accompanied by any necessary
documentation and reports to detail the quality issues. The project manager must be able to read and
understand quality measurement reports.
It is during Control Quality that the height of doors in a manufacturing process or the numb er ofbugs
per module will be measured. Quality control helps answer the following questions:
' Are the results of our work meeting agreed—upon standards and thereby meeting requirements?
' What are the actual variances from the standards?
' Are the variances from standards or processes within acceptable limits?
i What changes in the project should be considered?
Outcomes Of Control Quality
Outputs include measurements. work performance information:
veriﬁed deliverables and possibly change requests as well as up dates to the quality management plan, issue
log, test and evaluation documents, lessons learned, and the risk register.
To better understand questions relating to Control Quality, you should be familiar with the following
terms.
' Mutual Exclusivity The exam may reference statistical terms such as "mutual exclusivity” Two
events are said to be mutually exclusive if they cannot both occur in a single trial. For example, ﬂip-
ping a coin once cannot result in both a head and a tail.
' Probability This term refers to the likelihood that something will occur. Probability is usually
expressed as a decimal or a fraction.
' Normal Distribution A normal distribution is the most common probability density distribution
chart. It is in the shape of a bell curve and used to measure variations (see the example in Exercise 3.1
in this chapter).
' Statistical Independence Statistical independence means the probability of one event occurring
does not affect the probability of another event occurring. For example: the probability of rolling a six
on a die is statistically independent from the prob ability of getting a ﬁve on the next roll.
' Standard Deviation (or Sigma) As we’ve already discussed, one measure of a range is its standard
deviation. It denotes what would be considered a statistically stable process or output. This concept
is also sometimes stated as a measure of how far you are from the mean (not the median). (Remember
(P — 0)/6 is the beta distribution formula for standard deviation, using pessimistic and optimistic
estimates. as described in the r“Schedule” chapter.)
Quality Management Tools and Techniques
Understanding both predictive and adaptive tools and techniques for quality management can help you get
several questions right on the exam. The tools and techniqes used to manage quality have been combined
in this section to make it easier for you to understand them and to distinguish what tools are used in each
of the three quality management processes in the PMB OK? Guide. Notice that some tools and techniques
can be used in more than one quality process,1 and pay special attention to the agile tools as they can be used
to tailor the overall process of quality management.

Mind Mapping As discussed in the “Scope" chapter, a mind map is a diagram of ideas or notes to help gen—
erate, classify, or record information. It is used here to facilitate the gathering of quality requirements and
illustrate their impacts on other parts of project planning.
Flowcharts Flowcharts may also be referred to as process ﬂows or process maps, and can be used in many
parts of project management. They show how a process or system ﬂows from beginning to end, how the
elements interrelate, alternative paths the process can take, and how the process translates inputs into out-
puts. Flowcharts can be planned in to be used to:
' Show the connections between the supplier, input, process, output, and customer in a process (called
the SIPOC model).
' Help determine the cost of quality by mapping the expected monetary value of pursuing paths of
conformance and nonconformance to quality.
' Determine how processes will be measured for conformance and eﬁectiveness.
' Deﬁne and communicate processes that will be used on the project.
You can also use this ﬂowcharting in planning to visualize a process and ﬁnd potential quality problems
or quality control issues. Imagine that work results are passed to four departments for approval. Might this
lead to quality problems? What about an unﬁnished, fragile product in a manufacturing environment?
Would the quality of the product be reduced if it needed to be passed by hand from person to person?
A generic example of a ﬂowchart is shown in ﬁgure 8.2.

FIGURE 8.2 Flowchart
Test and Inspection Planning Planning quality in includes determining how the team will conﬁrm that the
required level of quality has been achieved in the completed project deliverables, as well as how the deliv-
erables will be evaluated for performance and reliability. Testing methods, which vary depending upon the
type of product, service, or result being created by the project, are used to control quality. The quality man-
agement plan is created to prevent quality issues.
Manage Quallty TDDIS and Techniques
The following are tools and techniques of Manage Quality
in the 13112113055E Guide.
Ch ECKIlSt
A checklistcan be used to conﬁrm that the steps of a process have all been completed. It may
also be used to analyze defects discovered in quality inspections, looking for issues within the process, and
to assess whether a deliverable meets the acceptance criteria.
Cause-and-Eﬁect (Fishbone, lshikawa, or Why-Why) Diagrams”
A team can use cause—and—effect
diagrams to conﬁrm that policies and procedures are being followed and that metrics are being used
correctly, and that they were adequate to produce the required level of quality in project deliverables. Figure
3.4 is an example of a cause—and—effect diagram.

In this process, histograms are used to analyze the type and frequency of defects in
order to identify where the quality plan and processes may need improvement as the project progresses.
Figure 3.5 and ﬁgure 8.6 are examples of histo grams.
Scatter Diag ram 316
This diagram tracks two variables to determine their relationship to the quality of
the results. Figure 3.7 shows three examples of scatter diagrams.
DDGUITIBHI AﬂﬂlYSlS
Document analysis involves reviewing the results of testing and other quality
reports to identify ways in which the quality management plan and processes may not be supporting the
production of deliverables that meet the project quality requirements.
Alternatives AHEIIYSIS
It is important to consider all the ways to solve an issue or problem. In Manage
Quality, alternatives analysis may be used to evaluate which action would best impact the results of
quality management efforts or processes. For example, would a new automated testing tool be more
beneﬁcial than redeﬁning the testing process?
Design Of Experiments (DUE 17’
This technique can be used for alternatives analysis and can quickly
discover optimal conditions in which to produce a quality deliverable. Experimentation is performed to
determine statistically what variables will improve quality. For example, DOE can be used to look for
ways to deliver the same level of quality for less cost. D CE is a fast and accurate technique that allows you
to systematically change the important factors in a process and see which combinations have an optimal
imp act on the project deliverables. For example, designers might use D OE to determine which combina—
tion of materials, structure, and construction will produce the highest-quality pro duct. Performing indi-
vidual experiments for each variable in a process to assess their impacts on quality can be time-consuming
and can overlook interactions among variables.
Process Analysis“
Process analysis is part of the continuous improvement effort and focuses on
identifying improvements that might be needed in project processes. Have you ever worked on a project
where some of the activities or work packages were repeated? This often happens when projects have
multiple installations, such as a project to install software onto hundreds of computers. The lessons
learned on the ﬁrst few installations are used to improve the process for the remaining installations.
Though this often happens naturally, planning it into certain points in the project improves results.
RDDI Cause Analysis
Root cause analysis in Manage Quality seeks to identify the processes, proce—
dures, and policies within the plan that may not be working or that may need adjustment. Identifying the
root cause of a quality problem or defect helps the team determine how to prevent it from recurring.
Failure analysis
This is a speciﬁc type of root cause analysis. It analyses failed components of deliver-
ables or failed processes to determine what led to that failure. Corrective action or change requests are
likely outcomes of this type of analysis.
Multicriteria DECISION AﬂﬂlYSlS
The project manager must facilitate a number of decisions regarding
quality. A decision—making technique, multicriteria decision analysis is a complex method of numerically
assessing options based on criteria such as time, cost, and quality. It can be used throughout a project to
help the team reach agreement regarding the best way to solve a problem or improve quality. In Manage
Quality, the team may use this technique when considering whether to adjust the quality management
plan or speciﬁc processes or procedures. A prioritization matrix (described earlier under Matrix
Diagrams) is a simpler decision-making technique.
Flowchar I819
In Manage Quality, ﬂowcharts may be used to study the steps of a process leading to a
quality defect. This analysis might uncover confusion among the team or point out ways the process
needs to be adjusted to make it more eﬂective.

E I G H T
Affinity Diagrams
We ﬁrst saw this technique in the Collect Requirements process. In Manage Quality,
aﬁinity diagrams can help you organize and group the results of re ot cause analysis. For example, in Control
Quality you may have determined the cause of a variance, product defect, or a deliverable not meeting
requirements. You can use this information in the Manage Quality process to determine whether a change
to the policies, procedures, and standards in the quality management plan would best address the root
cause of the problems.
AUdItS
Imagine a team of auditors walking into your e r"ice one day to check up on you and the project.
Their job is to see if you are complying with company policies, processes, practices as deﬁned in the quality
management plan, and to determine whether these being used are e ”icient and effective. This scenario
represents a quality audit. Do net think of a quality audit as a negative event. Instead, a good quality audit
will look fer new lessens learned and effective practices that your project can contribute to the performing
organization. The work of a project is not only to produce the product of the project; it could also contribute
to the best practices within the organisation, making the organization better.
If you do not have a team of auditors from the quality department coming to see you on your projects,
do you take on the responsibility of looking for opportunities to identify lessons learned and best practices
on your projects? Although quality audits are usually done by the quality department, the project manager
can lead this effort if the performing organization does not have such a department.
Design IDI‘ X
Design for X is another way of analyzing variables to evaluate both the effectiveness of the
quality management plan and the team’s ability to meet objectives. The X in the name can represent an
attribute of quality, such as reliability, security, or serviceability. If the plan is not delivering the intended
results in relation to the variable being analyzed, Design for X can help determine what changes or adjust—
ments are needed.
Problem-Solving
Think of how important this technique might be when you encounter quality prob-
lems. Gaining a good understanding of the real problem is the ﬁrst step towards ﬁnding an eﬁective and
long-lasting solution. Problem-solving can be used when considering quality improvements or to deter-
mine how best to respond to deﬁciencies identiﬁed in quality audits.
The following are the steps used to analyse quality (and other) problems:
Deﬁne the real or root problem—not what is presented to you or what appears to be the problem.
Analyze the problem.
Identify solutions.
Pick a solution.
w a t e r - 1 e
Implement a solution.

## Review the solution, and conﬁrm that the solution solved the problem.


COIIII'UI Quality TUOIS and Techniques
There are many tools and techniques that may be used to
control quality. Regardless of the method used, the ultimate goal is to test (verify) that each deliverable
meets the metrics and requirements as stated in the plan, including the customer’s acceptance criteria, and
that it is ready to move to the Validate Scope process.
Ch EGKIISIS
Information about the quality of interim deliverables can be gathered using quality check-
lists. A quality checklist can be a list of items to inspect, a list of steps to be performed, or a picture of the
item to be inspected, with space to note any defects found.
In Control Quality, checklists are used to determine that all required features and functions are
included, and that they meet acceptance criteria. Checklists may be part of the test and evaluation
do cuments created in Manage Quality.

Checksheet
Statistical sampling Let’s think about the process of manufacturing doors. There would likely be some
a lowable variation in the height and weight of the doors being manufactured. Even so, the doors must be
checked to see if they meet quality standards on the project. What if inspecting each door would cause
damage or take too much time? Then you may need to take a statistically valid sample. It is best to take a
sample of a population if you believe there are not many defects, or if studying the entire population would
take too long, cost too much, or be too destructive.
The sample size and frequency of measurements are determined in planning; the sampling is done in
control. Keep in mind that statistical sampling can also be done for project management activities. For
example, you may initially check the on-time status for 5 out of 50 of a group’s activities. If you ﬁnd issues
in those 5, you can assume there will be more issues in the remaining 45 activities.
Questionnaires and Surveys
Questionnaires and surveys may be used in Control Quality to gather
data on details of problems or defects, or to conﬁrm that customers or end users are satisﬁed with deliver-
ables that have been deployed on the project. The results can be used to determine whether conformance
to quality has been achieved.
Performance REVIEWS
The project manager or quality department may conduct periodic performance
reviews to formally assess how the project is doing in terms of meeting quality requirements. Such a review
involves comparing the results of control measurements to metrics identiﬁed in the quality management
plan. It may bring to light changes necessary to achieve quality requirements.
RDDI Cause Analysis
Root cause analysis is used to identify the cause of quality problems, including
defects, to determine how they can be remedied.
IHSDBCIIDH
Inspections are used to verify that deliverables meet the requirements. Inspections may be
referred to as waikthroughs and generally include measurement of project deliverables. Checkists and
control charts may be used to capture the data. Inspections are also used to check that previously approved
changes have been made correctly, and that the changes have provided the intended results (validated
changes).
COI‘III‘UI Ch ﬂl‘tSm
Control charts are established in Manage Quality, and the parameters such as the mean,
speciﬁcation limits, and control limits (all deﬁned later in this section) are determined. Control charts are
used in Control Quality to help determine if the results of a process are within acceptable limits.
To better understand the need for control charts, imagine a door manufacturer is undertaking a
project to create a new production line. To make sure the production facility will create doors that meet
quality standards, it’s essential to monitor the processes and output so the new production line can become
an ongoing business operation. Would each door be the same exact height? Weight? Not likely. Instead

E I G H T
there is a range, however small, that is acceptable. Each deer should be within the range of normal and
acceptable limits.
During the Control Quality precess, samples are taken and plotted on the chart (see the small squares
shown on the control chart in Exercise 8.1). The control chart shows whether the samples are within
acceptable limits. If the data does net fall within the acceptable range, the results are considered to be "out
of control,” which indicates a problem that needs to be handled.
A control chart can also be used to represent and monitor data on project performance, such as cost
and schedule variances.
New that we have discussed the basic concepts of a control chart, let’s leek at some of the related
terms you should know fer the exam. The following can be indicated on a control chart.
Upper and Lewer Centre] Limits11 Centrel limits are often shown as two dashed lines and are the
acceptable range of variation of a process or measurement’s results. Control limits indicate what is stable
versus unstable (out of control). Every process is expected to have some variation in its results, as in the
deer size example. The team and stakeholders determine the appropriate upper and lower control limits for
quality metrics. Data points within this range are generally thought of as "in control,” excluding the rule of
seven (described later in this section) and are an acceptable range of variation. Data points outside this
range indicate the process is out of control.
Note that outside of control charts a project manager can have control limits fer many things. How
about for a work package? Is one hour late in its delivery a problem? How about one day? Control limits
help the project manager knew when te act.
Mean (Average) The mean is indicated by a line in the middle of the control chart. It shows the middle of
the range of acceptable variation. A normal distribution curve represents the acceptable range of variance
around a mean, and it falls within the boundaries of the control limits.
Sp eciﬁcatien Limitsn While control limits represent the performing organization’s standards fer quality,
speciﬁcation limits represent the customer’s exp ectatiens—or the contractual re quirements—fer
performance and quality on the project. Speciﬁcation limits are characteristics of the measured process and
are net inherent. In ether words, speciﬁcation limits are net calculated based on the control chart, instead,
they are inputs from the customer. Therefore, they can appear either inside or outside the control limits.
To meet the customer’s speciﬁcation limits, the performing organisation’s standards fer quality
(control limits) must be stricter than these of the customer. Agreeing to do a project when your work does
net meet the customer’s quality standards adds waste and extra management to the project to sort out
acceptable items. On the exam, assume that speciﬁcation limits are outside the upper and lower
control limits.
Out of Centre] The process is out ef a state of statistical control under either eftwe circumstances:
' A data point falls eutside ef the upper or lower control limit.
' There are nonrandom data points, these maybe within the upper and lower control limits, such as the
rule of seven (described next).
Think of "out of control” as a lack of consistency and predictability in the process or its results. Also be
aware that "out of control” is sometimes referred to as “out of tolerance” and control limits may be called
"tolerances” in agile environments.
Rule efSevenﬂ’ The rule of seven is a general rule, or heuristic. It refers to a group or series of nonrandom
data points that total seven on one side of the mean. The rule of seven tells you that, altheugh none of these
points are outside of the control limits, they are not random and the process is out of centrel. The project
manager should investigate this type of situation and ﬁnd a cause.

Histograms
As shown in ﬁgure 8.5, a histogram shows data in the form of bars or columns. A typical
histogram presents data in no particular order and without reference to time. The results of measurements
taken in Control Quality are displayed on a histogram to determine the problems that need the most imme-
diate attention or that are most like to present the project from achieving its quality requirements. The
Manage Quality process will analyze these problems and defects to determine if the cause is related to
processes or the quality management plan.

A Pareto diagram or Pareto chart is a commonly used type of histogram that arranges
the results from most frequent to least frequent to help identify which root causes are resulting in the most
problems._loseph Juran adapted Vilfredo Pareto’s 30/20 rule to create the BOXED principle (also known as
the Pareto Principle), which states that 30 percent of problems are due to 20 percent of the root causes.
Addressing the root cause of the most frequent problems makes the greatest impact on quality.

' Every few months (typically), at the end of each release, the customer reviews the deliverable
to validate that it is "done” and ready for release.
Although the ab eve examples are derived from a software development environment, the same
principles apply to other kinds of agile projects; only the speciﬁcs differ. Let’s take the example of a group
of instructional designers who are creating the lessen plan for a new course. They start by collaborating on
the course goals, exchanging ideas in real time. While writing the modules, they meet frequently to review
the modules and coordinate their efforts. Once they have a ﬁrst draft of the modules, they conduct a small
sample test to get feedback from a volunteer group. Even after the course gees live, they continue to ask fer
student feedback via anonymous surveys or ether techniques to ensure the course works for the
intended audience.

Retrospectives A retrospective is a meeting that may be held after a release, or even the entire project.
However, this term most often refers to the meeting that is held at the end of each short, time-boxed itera-
tion of product development. Regardless of which part of the project is being reviewed, this meeting is an
opportunity for the members of the development team to inspect and improve their methods and team-
work. During the retrospective, the following questions may be discussed:
' What is going well?
I What areas could use improvement?
It What should we be doing differently?
Daily Stand-ope A daily stand—up meeting is also an important mechanism for identifying quality prob—
lems. Note that the key question in this meeting asks whether there are any problems or impediments to
project work. The purpose of this question is to bring potential issues and problems to the surfaceearly—
rather than waiting until an issue or schedule delay occurs. When a concern is mentioned in a daily stand-
up meeting, it is the responsibility of the project manager to further investigate the issue and resolve it.
Lead and CYCIB Time Lead time is a diagnostic tool that can be used to help identify and diagnose prob-
lems. This concept measures how long something takes to go through the entire process, for example, from
design to shipping, or from requirements gathering through development to deployment.

Cycle time is a subset of lead time that measures how long something takes to go through part of the
process, such as from product assembly to painting, or from coding to testing. For example, the cycle time
for building a user story begins when the team starts working on it and ends when that item is ﬁnished,
accepted, and begins delivering business value.

FIGURE 3.10 Lead time and cycle time illustrated on a kaabaa board
In ﬁgure 8.10 the lead time for a new feature in a software project spans the entire life cycle, from goal—
setting through development and acceptance, until it is done. You can also see the cycle time for its
development and testing, which is a component of its lead time. So lead time is how long it takes for the
entire process, and cycle time is how long it takes for one component of that process.
CVCIB Time, WIP and Throughput” WIP is Work in Progress — how many things you are working on but not
ﬁnished yet. Throughput is the amount of work that can be processed through a system in a given amount
of time—such as the amount of work the team can get done in one iteration. (This can also be expressed as
their average completion time.) Cycle time is a function of MP and throughput and can be calculated by
using the following formula:
WIP
Example:
CYCIE time = —
Cycle Time = 13X27 = .66 (or 6.6 days for a 2-week iteration)
Throughput
To illustrate, let’s say a development iteration is 2 weeks (10 working days). The velocity (how many
story points can be completed) is 2.7 points per iteration — this is the throughput. The MP is 13 points. So,
18 divided by 27 equals a cycle time of 6.6 working days.
Let’s look at the relationship between cycle time and work in progress (MP) to see why this link is so
important for quality in agile. Excessive WIP is associated with a numb er of problems:
i It represents money that has been invested but isn’t producing any return yet.
' It hides bottlenecks and masks eiﬁciency issues.
i It carries the risk of potential rework if quality issues are discovered.
It is because of these risks that agile and hybrid approaches place a big emphasis on limiting WIP. And
in order to do so, the project manager must pay close attention to cycle time, since long cycle times lead to
increased amounts of WIP. This is why agile and hybrid approaches break the project work down into small
batches and focus on ﬁnishing items and getting them accepted by the customer as soon as possible.

release. Lean, Kaizen, and just in time (JIT), discussed next, are often associated with change-driven
projects.
Lean The term ”lean” comes from the concept of lean manufacturing, a practice that is more than 100
years old. The principle behind lean is to remove waste from a process. Agile is a derivative of this approach,
which has evolved to encompass the e r”icient use of human as well as physical resources. The goal of lean
management is to eliminate waste of time, effort, and resources, as shown in ﬁgure 9.1.
Kaizen The Japanese term keizen is synonymous with continuous improvement. It means to alter (lest)
and improve or make better (zen). This term is used in quality management, but it also applies to other
aspects of a project, including resource management.
Just in Time (JIT) If a project is using a just in time (JIT) system for physical resources, the strategy to
manage those resources will be diﬁerent than if all the inventory, materials, and supplies are purchased and
delivered at the beginning of the project.

FIGURE 9.1 Lean core concepts
In the Plan Resource Management process, a project manager uses a variety of items, which are
discussed in the following sections.
Project Management Plan The existing components of the project management plan are going to help
you plan the management of people. Before you can deﬁne roles, responsibilities, reporting structure, and
so forth, you’ll need to consider information about the life cycle and processes already determined for the
project, how work will be done, the communication needs of stakeholders, and other factors from the proj-
ect management plan.
The scope baseline includes descriptions of the project deliverables, which will help you determine
the resources needed to create those deliverables.
The quality management plan includes the agreed-upon level of quality and grade of physical resources
needed to satisfy the requirements of the project. These decisions will impact the team’s options in terms of
how and where they will obtain those resources.
The stakeholder engagement plan includes the approach to involving stakeholders—including the
team. It provides direction for engaging stakeholders in the planning, decision-making, and work on the
project. The stakeholder register lists the individuals and groups who are project stakeholders, and it
includes analysis of factors such as each stakeholder’s power and interest related to the project.

RACI Chartl (Responsible, Accountable, Consult, and Inform) This chart is a type of responsibility
assignment matrix that deﬁnes role assignments more clearly than the example shown in ﬁgure 9.2. Instead
ef the P and S shewn in the ﬁgure, the letters R fer Respeusible, A for Accountable, C for Consult, and I fer
Inferm are used. Note that multiple resources may be responsible, informed, or consulted, but only one
person is held accountable.
Organizational Breakdown Structure3 An organizational breakdown structure can be used to assign
project responsibilities to divisions or departments within the organization, such as marketing, product
development, or IT. In a matrix organization, the preject manager will have to interface with the managers
of each department involved in the project to coordinate availability and scheduling of human and physical
resources that will be used on the project. Figure 9.3 is an example of an organizational breakdown structure.

N I N E Resources
Work Breakdown Structure Are you surprised to see the INES here? Can you think of how the WES
could be a valuable tool in creating the resource management plan? In the “Scope” chapter, we said that all
project work must be represented in the WES. It follows, then, that the WES is a great tool to ensure that
each work package has an n{ownerﬂ—a team member responsible to complete that work.
Physical Resource Documentation In addition to mapping out the roles and responsibilities of people on
the project, the project manager must plan ahead for usage of physical resources. This aspect of planning is
as important as planning for the management of people!
The project manager must document the physical resource needs, which may involve adapting tools
and techniques often used for other purposes. For example, since the WES shows the project deliverables
broken down into work packages, it could be used to plan resource requirements for each of those work
packages. The WES could also be used as a reference to ensure that all necessary physical resources for each
work package have been secured.
Organizational Theory Organizational theory studies organizations to identify how they solve problems
and how they maximize e "i ciency and productivity and meet the expectations of stakeholders. Such analy-
sis helps the organization develop effective resource management policies and procedures for the acquisi—
tion, management, and evaluation of human and physical resources. Adopting practices such as JIT, Lean,
Kaizen, or Sis: Sigma inﬂuences how projects will handle the management of physical resources.
The outputs of the plan resource management process are discussed in the following sections.
Resource Management Plan
The primary result (output) of planning resource management is, of
course, a resource management plan. If you manage small projects, think for a moment about what the
resource management effort would involve on a large project that has hundreds of assigned resources.
Would it take more work than you are doing now to manage all the resources on your project? Large
projects require a plan for when and how resources will be added, managed, and released from the project.
This is what the resource management plan provides.
Components of the resource management plan include the following:
' Human Resources
— Identiﬁcation of human resource requirements (who, when, how many, what skills, what
level of expertise, duration)
- Roles and responsibilities (described earlier in this chapter)
- Project organizational charts (described earlier in this chapter)
— Process for acquiring human resources (internal or procurement)
- Training, team development, and recognition (goals, what, when)
-* Project team management (team charter, ground rules, engagement, communications)
- Compliance (How will the project comply with any rules related to human resources?)
- Safety (policies to protect the resources)
— Release of human resources
' Physical Resources
— Identiﬁcation of physical resource requirements (what, when, how many, what type,
quality, grade, duration)
- Process for acquiring physical resources (internal or procurement)
- Inventory management
— Release of resources
A project manager must motivate their team, especially when working on a project in a matrix
organization. Have you ever wondered, "How do I get improved performance from people who do not
report directly to me in the organization?" If your team members are not motivated, it is nearly impossible
to be effective as a project manager. This is not to say that great project managers do not have issues with
motivating people, but they have the tools and knowledge to prevent and to deal with such problems.

Project Document Updates The assumption log is updated to reﬂect assumptions made in planning
regarding resources. These may include assumptions made about the availability, quantity, quality, or type
of human and/ or physical resources. Other assumptions made might relate to what type of rewards and
recognition will be effective, and how the releasing of resources should be managed. Assumptions can
change as the project progresses, and should be regularly assessed for validity. Incorrect assumptions may
create risks on the project.
Another document that may need to be updated is the risk register. Risks related to resources should
be added to the risk register, and then analyzed and prioritized along with other documented risks in the
risk management process.
Estimate Resource Requirements
PAGE 320
When estimating activity resources, the project manager and team determine the type and quantity of all
resources needed to complete project work. This includes people to perform the project work, and any
equipment or materials needed to fulﬁll the requirements of the project.
It’s important to note that the resource management plan provides documentation on estimating
methods that may be used when determining estimates. Other inputs include the scope baseline and the
activity list from Schedule Management. These inputs help to estimate the needed resources at the work
package level and activity level, respectively, and are important elements to create accurate estimates.
Another input from schedule management is activity attributes. Attributes provide speciﬁc information
about each activity, such as the type and amount of human and physical resources expected to be required
to complete them.
Cost estimates provide constraints in terms of resource estimating, as the resource costs must fall
within the cost baseline. Resource calendars identify organizational work hours and company holidays, and
show the availability of potential resources—both human and physical. Organizational process assets
include policies the project must follow when arranging for staff and needed equipment.
In the ”Schedule” and "Cost” chapters, we discussed estimating techniques used to develop the
schedule and budget. Several of these techniques, such as analogous estimating, may also be used to
estimate activity resources (see the "Schedule” and "Cost” chapters for a complete list).
Another tool you can use to estimate resources is a resource histogram. A resource histogram is a way
to visualize resource requirements, and compare needed resources and their availability, to better enable
estimating. As depicted in ﬁgure 9.5, a resource histogram is a bar chart that shows the numb er of resources
needed per time period , it also illustrates where there is a spike in the need for resources. If the materials,
equipment, or people are not available when they are needed, the project manager must evaluate available
options, which may include negotiating with another department to provide the resources, procuring the
resources from an external source, or adjusting the project schedule to do the work when the resources
are available.

Resource leveling is a technique that may be used to change a project to minimize the peaks and
valleys of resource usage (level the resources). The project manager could use a histogram to help in
performing that activity if resources are limited.
At the end of this pro cess, the team will have determined resource requirements for project activities,
including the co st, quantity, and availability of human and physical resources. They may choose to

Acquire and Release Resources
This process involves following the resource management plan to secure all resources needed for the
project. The resource management plan describes how resources will be acquired and released, and the
resource requirements documentation tells the project manager what types of resources are needed. The
project schedule and cost baseline provide essential information regarding when resources will be required
and the amount of funds budgeted to pay for them.
To understand why this is an executing pro cess , think of a large project that may last several years and
require hundreds of people and lots of physical resources. A planning team is acquired early in planning to
help the project manager. However, many of the people and other resources needed to do the work may not
be needed until long after planning starts. The ﬁnal list of resources might include contractors, sellers, and
people who will work on the project years into the future and may not even be employed by the company
until needed. Likewise, the physical resources may be purchased closer to the time they are needed, to
avoid the need to warehouse inventory. Acquiring the planned resources as they are needed is an example
of rolling wave planning.

TRICKS
In a predictive-based approach, the project manager is acquiring and releasing human
resources as their work is needed and completed. Agile environments typically call for keeping
a team stable and bringing projects to the team to maintain high performance. Variations on
these approaches depend on the project and business environment.
Acquiring resources begins by using the planning and estimating work, which identiﬁed the type and
quantity of resources needed. Let’s look ﬁrst at the process of acquiring the team, and then at acquiring
physical resources.
When it’s time to ﬁnalize the people who will perform the work of the project, the project manager
may be required to negotiate with functional (resource) managers, other project managers, and the
resources themselves in order to arrange their participation on the project. Ifthe resources must be hired or
contracted, work with the human resource or procurement departments may be necessary.
The project manager will also use the resource requirements documentation as a reference in
acquiring physical resources. Often this involves working with the procurement or inventory management
department.
A project manager has to work with the resources they are given, or acquire those that are needed.
Resource availability ( as indicated by resource calendars) and the project schedule must be coordinated to
ensure that the right resources will be available when they are required.
To review, acquiring project resources includes all the following:
I Knowing which resources are preassigned to the project and conﬁrming their availability
' Negotiating for the best possible resources
' Hiring new employees
' Hiring resources through the contracting process from outside the performing organization——
outsourcing
' Using JIT, Lean, or other methods as required by the organization
' Managing the risk of resources becoming unavailable
Types Of Teams
The makeup of the ﬁnal project team can take one or a combination of forms, such as
the following:
' Dedicated Most of the team members work full-time and exclusively on the project. From the per-
spective of the project manager, this is the easiest form of team to work with, as team members can
dedicate most of their energy to the project and often report directly to the project manager. Dedicated
teams are most common in projectized organizations, but can also be found in matrix organizations;
they’re least likely to exist in functional organizations. Dedicated teams are important on rapidly
changing agile projects. In these environments, more information is communicated face-to-face and
tacit knowledge is more valuable.
' Part—time Team members and the project manager spend a portion of their time working on the
project while also working on other projects andf or their usual (non-project-related) work responsi-
bilities. Part-time teams are most often seen in functional and matrix organizations.
' Partnership In cases where several organizations undertake a project, the teams are likely to consist
of people from each of the participating organizations, plus the project manager from the organiza—
tion taking the lead on the project. Such teams may oﬁer advantages, such as cost savings, but they can
be di ”Icult to manage.

' Virtual When multiple organizations, o Ices, groups, or individuals are involved on a project, the
geographic distance of these organizations can necessitate the creation of virtual teams (see the
“Virtual Teams” section of this chapter). Agile organizations usually try to avoid virtual teams where
possible. Technology helps agile teams work virtually, but face-to-face communication is always
preferred.

For the exam, be aware of how the type of team described in a situational question could
OF THE
impact the project manager’s work. For example, with a dedicated team, the project manager
TRADE will have more control over the team members. With a part-time team, the project manager
will likely have to negotiate with functional managers and leadership to acquire and retain team
members. With a partnership or virtual team, coordination among the various organizations or locations
might require increased risk management work, more eEort to coordinate communication, and so on.
Let’s review several of the ways a project manager may obtain resources.
Preassignment As noted earlier, sometimes resources are assigned before the project begins. Preassigned
resources are documented in the project charter. This relates to both physical and team resources.
Negotiation When resources are not preassigned, they may be acquired through negotiation. You will see
negotiation referenced frequently on the exam as it relates to gaining resources from within your organiza-
tion and in procurement situations. To negotiate for human or physical resources from within the organiza-
tion, the project manager should do the following:
i Know the needs of the project and its priority within the organization.
' Be able to express how the resources manager will beneﬁt from assisting the project manager.
' Understand that the resources manager has their own work to do and may not gain beneﬁts from
supporting the project.
' Do not ask for the best resources if the project does not need them.
'I Be able to prove, using project management tools such as the network diagram and project schedule,
why the project requires the stated quantity and quality of resources.
' Use negotiation as an opportunity to discover what the resources manager will need from the project
manager in order to manage their own resources.
' Build a relationship so the project manager can call on the expertise of the resources manager later in
the project if necessary.
' Work with the resources manager to deal with situations as they arise.
Notice the previous list goes beyond traditional negotiation strategy and includes elements of
professional responsibility. Negotiations are most eﬁective when the interactions between participants are
positive and there is some room for give and take on each side. Professional and social responsibility is
discussed throughout this book and is relevant in every part of a project manager’s job.
Virtual Teams Not all teams meet face-to-face. Virtual teams have to rely on other forms of communica-
tion to work together. Although virtual teams can be more challenging to manage because of communica-
tion issues and diﬁerences in schedules, languages, and/ or culture, they oﬁer the opportunity to beneﬁt
from the expertise of team members who are in distant locations or who are otherwise unavailable to par-
ticipate with the team onsite.
The big challenge for virtual teams is ﬁnding ways to create “virtual colocation”—in other words,
trying to replicate the beneﬁts of face-to-face collaboration, osmotic communication, tacit knowledge, and
improved relationships that come from working near each other. Fortunately, the same tools making virtual
teams more common also provide ways to simulate the beneﬁts of face-to—face collaboration. Let’s look at
some examples.
' Videoconferencing and live chat These tools can be used to simulate a shared team environment
and allow virtual stakeholders to chat and interact as if their colleagues were within earshot.
' Interactive whiteboards These tools allow team members to share content with multiple locations
and collaborate in a visual whiteboard-type environment.

Develop Team
PAGE 336
Similar to many project management processes, the Develop Team process is ongoing throughout project
work. This process should result in decreased turnover, enhanced individual knowledge and skills, and
improved teamwork. The project manager works to lead, empower, and motivate the team to achieve high
performance and to meet project objectives. This is accomplished through efforts to create an environment
conducive to building trust and cooperation, and by providing training and support to the team. Team
members are recognized for their efforts.
A plan for making all of this happen should be included in the resource management plan. The project
manager can also make use of lessons learned earlier in the project and on other, similar projects to enhance
their ability to effectively develop the team.
9.3 Exercise In your Exercise Notebook, write down the answer to this question: What do you
think a project manager needs to do to develop a team?
Answer An exercise like this can be tempting to skip. But remember that the only effective way to
ﬁnd gaps is to test your knowledge and understanding of the goals, actions, and beneﬁts of the
process before you look at the answers.
You may do some of the activities listed below on your projects, but you might not plan them
in or do them consistently or consciously. These activities are part of proper project management.
Keep them in mind for the exam to help you understand the situations described and select the best
answer choices.
When managing a project, the project manager must ensure that the project team is working
together as effectively and efﬁciently as possible. This may include any of the following:
' Using soft skills, such as mentoring, leadership, negotiation, empathy, and communication
' Encouraging teamwork
' Communicating honestly, effectively, and in a timely manner with the people assigned to
your team
' Assessing team members’ strengths and weaknesses, preferences, and learning styles to help
the team work together
' Establishing and maintaining trust between the project manager and each team member, and
among all stakeholders
' Collaborating with the team to create a shared vision, make good, bought—into decisions, and
to ﬁnd mutually beneﬁcial solutions to problems
' Capitalizing on cultural differences
' Holding team-building activities
' Building a sense of team identity
' Setting realistic goals
' Providing training for team members as needed
I Encouraging team members to uphold the agreements documented in the team charter
'- Assisting the team with conﬂict resolution when needed

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs9 Maslow’s message is that the highest motivation for most people is to
contribute and to use their skills. Maslow called this “self-actualieation.” He created a hierarchy of needs to
explain how people are motivated and stated that a person cannot ascend to the next level until the levels
below are fulﬁlled. See ﬁgure 9.6.
Seit—tuiﬁiiment growth, teaming
Accomplishment reapect attention, appreciation
to lie, affection, approval, friends, association
l

Need for air; water; food, housing, ctothing
FIGURE 9.6 A representation ofMaslow’Er hierarchy of needs
McClelland’s Theory of NeedsJlﬂ (or Acquired Needs Theory) This theory states that people are most
motivated by one of three needs. A person falling into one need category would be managed differently
than a person falling into another category. The following table explains the three need categories.
Achievement
These people should be given projects that are challenging but are reachable.
They like recognition.
A "iliation
These people work best when cooperating with others.
They seek approval rather than recognition.
Power
People whose need for power is socially oriented, rather than personally oriented, are
eﬁective leaders and should be allowed to manage others.
These people like to organize and inﬂuence others.
Herzberg’s Two—Factor Theory of Motivation11 Herxberg’s theory deals with hygiene factors and moti-
vating agents.
Hygiene Factors: Poor hygiene factors may destroy motivation, but improving them, under most
circumstances, will not improve motivation. Hygiene factors are not so 'lcient to motivate people.
Examples of hygiene factors include the following:
' Working conditions
' Relationships at work
" Salary
' Security
' Personal life
' Status
Motivating Agents: People are motivated, energized, and engaged by the work itself, including factors
such as the following:
'- Responsibility
' Professional growth
' Self-actualization
' Recognition

So; the lesson here is that motivating people is best done by rewarding them and letting them grow.
Giving raises is not the most effective motivator. This is generally good news for project managers, as they
often do not have any inﬂuence over the pay raises of their team members. Solving an individual or team
issue may mean that you have to make certain that basic needs are met within the project.
Team Building
Team building can play a major role in team development—helping to form the project
team into a cohesive group working for the best interests of the project and enhancing project performance.
Make sure you knew the following key points about team building:
' It is the project manager’s job to guide, manage, and improve the interactions of team members.
i The project manager should work to improve trust and cohesiveness among the team members.
'I The project manager should incorporate team-building activities into project activities.
' Team building requires a concerted effort and continued attentien throughout the life of the project.
' WES creation is a team-building activity because it allows team members to actively engage in the
planning and ownership of the project; similar beneﬁts occur when the team is involved in other
planning efforts, as well.
' Team building should start early in the life of the project.
Let’s spend a little more time on the concept of trust. First, think of project problems you have recently
experienced. New ask yourselfthe following questions: “Could these problems be caused by a lack of trust?
De team members trust each other? Do they trust me?” Your team needs to feel that you are working in the
best interests of the project, the company. and them—rather than in your own best interests. Trust is gained
or lost from the minute you meet each team member for the ﬁrst time. If the team does not trust you, you
cannot easily be successful. The team will not take your direction or follow your instructions, and the
proj ect will suffer.
An important role of a project manager is to create a psychologically safe work environment where
people can ask questions and show incomplete versions of their work without being criticized. Providing a
team with this level of trust increases collaboration and helps improve the project. Another common
method for increasing trust on agile projects is to engage the team in the development of estimates.
Remember when we discussed Planning Poker in the ”Schedule” chapter? Activities like Planning Poker
build trust amongst the team members, the estimate. and the solution.
Once you have trust. it can be lost if you are not honest and consistent. Assuming you work in a matrix
organization, how do you get people to cooperate if you do not have the ability to give them a raise or a
promotion? Trust _. as well as a recognition and reward system, are the answers.
Trust also affects, and is affected by, your reputation. Do you know what your reputation is? Many of
the people you meet know. Why not ask them about it so you can deal with any changes you need to make?
Team building helps build trust, and it is a concept that appears throughout the exam. It is an attitude,
as well as an action. D o you have the attitude of helping to build the team; or do you think the team members
should just follow instructions and accept what they are told? Some project managers think team building
is a minor activity; they bring in lunch for the team a couple times during their three-year project and
believe they have done team building.
Team building, like many parts of project management, is, in part, a science. The Tuckman ladder
model formally identiﬁes the following stages of team formation and development”
' Forming People are brought together as a team.
' Storming There are disagreements as people learn to work together.
' Norming Team members begin to build good working relationships and learn to trust the project
manager and each other.
H
' Performing The team becomes e lcient and works elfectively together. This is the point when the
project manager can give the most attention to develop individual team members.
' Adjeurning The project ends, and the team is disbanded.

N I N E Resources
New teams may go through each step, while teams that have worked together before may experience
a shortened version, possibly even skipping some of the early steps.
Team building is about more than just bringing resources together to make a project successful. A
project manager should look to assess the skills of the team and help team members grow, which will be
mutually beneﬁcial for the team members and the project. Team building also includes creating the best
possible atmosphere for the team to succeed, continuously assessing the performance and processes of the
team, and maintaining and encouraging the working order of the team.
Let’s look at a few other team—building models, Cockburn’s Shu—I-Ia—Ri model and Dreyfus’s model of
skill acquisition.
Shu-Ha-Ri Model of Skill Mastery” The Shu-Ha-Ri model describes a three-step process of increasing
mastery :
Sim: Obeying the rules—shat means "to keep, protect, or maintain.”
Ho: Consciously moving away from the rules—ho means "to detach or break free.”
Ri: Unconsciously ﬁnding an individual path—41' means "to go beyond or transcend.”
Cockburn’s model states when mastering a new skill or process, you move through three levels, or
stages. Beginners at the she level start by following the rules absorbed from their teachers, mentors, or
learning experiences. Once they’ve mastered those guidelines through practice, they reach the her level
where they can let go of the rules and work intuitively. The ﬁnal stage, 11', is full mastery, at this point they
have integrated so thoroughly that they transcend the rules and strike out onto new paths for others
to follow.
One application of the Shu-I—Ia—Ri model addresses the appropriate time and place for agile process
tailoring. When a team is new to agile, it’s best to start by following a method that has already been tested,
proven, and reﬁned by others. The team needs to practice that system and develop some mastery over it
before they can understand how and why all the pieces work together.
Dreyfus Model of Adult Skill Acquisition” This model by Stuart B. Dreyfus suggests that adults learn
new skills over ﬁve stages—novice, advanced beginner, competent, proﬁcient, and expert. In addition to
improving your skills as you move through each of these stages your level of commitment, approach to
decision making, and perspective on the task evolve as well.

Let’s examine each of the ﬁve stages of this model.
' Novice: Novices follow the rules they have been given and make analytical decisions with limited
knowledge. For example, if you are learning to drive a manual transmission, you might be told to
change gears as the engine approaches 2,500 rpm. ﬁlthough this rule is a good start, it could lead to
problems if you drive on a hill, which will inﬂuence when you should switch gears.
' Advanced beginner: At this stage, you are still following rules and making analytical decisions, but
new you have gained enough experience with real-world situations to begin to understand the con-
text of the rules. Continuing our example to decide when to change gears, you might use a guideline
such as "gear up when you hear the engine racing.”
' Competent: As you gain competence, the number of rules and guidelines for diﬁerent contexts
becomes everwhelming. Since you can’t apply them all, you begin to decide which rules are the best
fer each situation, this makes you feel more personally responsible for the choices you are making.
' Proﬁcient: At this level, your decision making is still analytical, but you are actively choosing the
best strategy rather than relying on the rules. In the process, you become more emotionally involved
in the task. For example, as a proﬁcient driver, you will have a gut feeling if you are approaching a
corner too fast on a rainy day.
' Expert: As you develop expertise, your decision making becomes intuitive—you can spontaneously
assess the alternatives and select the best appre ach without having tn ﬁrst analytically examine all the
possible strategies.
As you progress through the mastery of new skills, your perspective changes from neutral (no opinion)
tn choosing a perspective based on the circumstances, to an expert perspective rooted in your own
experiences. Meanwhile, your decision-making approach moves from analytical tn intuitive, and your
commitment moves from detached to involved.
Project managers who feel they do net have time fer team building typically are net using project
management best practices on their projects. Practices such as properly planning a project and managing
risks and quality save signiﬁcant amounts of time on a project, freeing up the project manager to do ether
important things, like team-building activities. When you take the exam, assume the project manager
featured in the questions has a team—building plan appropriate to the size and characteristics of the team.
Team-building activities can include the following:
' Involving team members in planning the project, including creating the WBS nr backlog as a group
I Taking classes together
' Retrospectives by the team to evaluate and improve their processes and interactions
' Collaborative problem—solving
' Milestone parties
' Holiday and birthday celebrations
'
Skills assessments and development
Conﬂict Management On any project, there may be conﬂicts among team members or between team
members and the project manager. Tais is especially true as a team is moving through the forming and
storming stages of development on the Tuckman ladder, discussed previously. It is a responsibility of the
project manager to address such conﬂicts, and facilitate resolution in a way that satisﬁes everyone involved.
We will further discuss conﬂict management in the "Manage Team” section.

N I N E Resources
Inﬂuencing ”Inﬂuencing” is a rather ambiguous term, but it is an important aspect of a project manager’s
role and it begins with the project manager actively listening to differing viewpoints expressed by team
members. Acknowledging these different perspectives and using communication and persuasive skills
helps the project manager develop mutual trust and, eventually, agreement within the team.
Individual and Team Assessments
Individual Assessments The more you know about each person on the project team}. the easier it is to
build trust, improve team communication, and encourage cooperation among team members. Personnel
assessment tools can help you learn more about team members by revealing how they make decisions,
interact with others, and process information. This information can give you insight into how to lead and
guide the team. Formal and informal assessment of team members by the project manager should continue
throughout the project.
Team Assessments The project manager completes formal and informal team performance assessments
as part of developing the project team. These assessments are meant to evaluate and enhance the eﬂective-
ness of the team as a whole. They may include an analysis of how much team members’ skills have improved
over the course of the project; how well the team is performing, interacting, and dealing with conﬂict 5 and
how they are progressing through the stages of team development. The assessments also help identify
needed support or intervention by the project manager. Such assessments should be ongoing while project
work is being done. The results of team assessments can be used to recognize the team’s progress or to moti—
vate them to improve. Think of team performance assessment as looking at team eﬂectiveness. The results
of these assessments are also inputs to the Manage Team process, in which the project manager uses them
to address issues identiﬁed.
Hybrid Assessments One way to assess individual team members is to designate them as I-shaped or
T-shaped. I-shaped team members specialize in one area, while T—shaped team members have a broad
range of skills. On hybrid and agile projects where the work is done iteratively and incrementally, teams
prefer T-shaped people who can help share the workload or adapt to the changing needs of the project.
T—shaped people help optimize value to the project by reducing bottlenecks.

Training
Team members may require training to perform on the project or to enhance their perfor-
mance. Such training can help team members, while also decreasing the overall project cost and schedule
through increased e ”lciency. If the training will beneﬁt the organization in the long run and/ or can be used
on future projects, it may be covered as an organizational cost. Otherwise, it is paid for by the project and
documented in the resource management plan and included in the project budget.

Communications technology is a valuable asset on any project, but particularly on virtual projects.
The project manager can use technology to build and support team efforts, even among team members
who may not ever have the opportunity to work in the same physical location. Of course, communications
technology also helps colocated team members stay in contact with each other and provide timely updates
to other team members as needed. The resource management plan includes speciﬁcs of how the project
manager will use available communications technology to meet the development needs of the team.
Recognition and Rewards
In the Develop Team process, the project manager appraises performance
and provides recognition and rewards in response to the work of the team or individual team members. To
be effective, such rewards should be determined based on the project managers understanding of what is
valuable to the team member or group being recognized. In addition to recognising past accomplishments,
rewards provide incentive for ongoing achievement and efforts.
OUIDUIS OI DBVBIOIJ Team
The results of team performance assessments are an output of this process.
As you will read in the next section, these results are an input to the Manage Team process, and they provide
insight for the project manager regarding continuous improvement of the team’s performance. Ifthe project
manager determines that changes to any of the project plans are necessary, change requests are processed
through integrated change control. Project documents, including the project schedule, team assignments,
and resource calendars may require such formal changes.
Organisational process assets updates may include changes to training requirements, newly adopted
team-building exercises, and revisions to existing templates for individual and team assessments. This
process may also result in up dates to documents such as the team charter and lessons learned register.
Manage Team
Manage Team involves all the day-to-day management activities that you’re likely already doing on your
projects. But there may be more to managing a team than you realize. Not knowing the responsibilities of a
project manager as described in this chapter could cause you to get questions wrong on the exam.
Details related to team-management activities are included in the resource management plan. Other
inputs to this process include the issue log (speciﬁcally issues related to the team), project team assignments
(documented in a RACI chart), and the team charter. Work performance reports provide an indication of
project progress as compared to the project management plan. The project manager uses this information
to identify necessary corrective actions. Results of team performance assessments from the Develop Team
process are analyzed to identify successes that need to be recognised, areas in which the team may need
additional support or assistance, and issues or conﬂicts that need to be resolved in this process. Ultimately,
team members are released as their work is completed.
In the Manage Team process, the project manager should perform the following activities to help
challenge team members to be part of a high performing team:
' Tracking and evaluating team performance
' Providing leadership
' Mentoring team members
' Planning and facilitating career development
' Dealing with team issues
' Facilitating conﬂict resolution
' Negotiating and inﬂuencing
' Adjusting plans based on performance data

Team Progress Part of supporting a high-performing team is assessing how each team member is fulﬁlling
their responsibilities. Project performance appraisals and progress tracking provide this information on
individual team members.
Burndown Charts Burndown charts track work to be done on a project. As work is completed, the pro g-
ress line on the chart will move downward, reﬂecting the amount of work that still needs to be done. They
are commonly used to measure the team’s progress in completing the project work. A sample burndown
chart is shown in ﬁgure 9.9.
Burnup Charts Burnup charts track the work that has been completed. Therefore.I over the course of the
proj act, the progress line on a burnup chart will move upward , showing the increasing amount of work that
has been completed. The big advantage of using a burnup chart is that it can show changes in scope, making
the impact of those changes visible. A sample burnup chart is shown in ﬁgure 9.9.

Every project is different and presents unique challenges to the project manager. Factors such as the
size and makeup of the team, the experience level of the team, and the complexity of the actual project work
must be considered by the project manager in their efforts to get the best from the team.
Consider the following questions:
Qaestion
You were just assigned to take over a project from another project manager who
is leaving the company. The previous project manager tells you that the project is
on schedule, but only because he has constantly pushed the team to perform.
What is the ﬁrst thing you should do as the new project manager?
A. Check risk status
B. Check cost performance
C. Determine a management strategy
D. Tell the team your objectives
Answer
C
Explanation Before you can do anything else, you need to ﬁnd a more effective management
strategy. A management strategy that encourages performance will provide a
sustainable framework for a motivated team to accomplish the required work.
This may require requesting a change to the resource management plan that

PDWBI'S 0f the Pl'DjBCt Manager
This section could be titled, “How to Get Cooperation from the
Team and Stakeholders.” Project managers can have diﬁicnlty getting people to cooperate and perform,
especially ifthey are working in a matrix organization. Understanding the following types of p ower can help:
' Formal (legitimate) This power is based on your position. Example: “I understand you disagree.
However, after careful evaluation, Ibelieve my decision is in the best interest of the team, and this is
what we are going to do.”
' Reward This power stems from the ability to give rewards. Example: "I understand that you want to
participate in the acceptance testing of this project. Because of your performance, I will assign you as
part of that team.”
' Penalty (coercive) This power comes from the ability to penalize team members. Example: “If this
does not get done on time, I will remove you from the group traveling to the customer meeting.”
' Expert This power comes from being the technical or project management expert. Example: ”This
project manager has been successful on other projects. Let’s give her a chance!”
' Referent This power comes from another person liking you, respecting you, or wanting to be like
you. It is the power of charisma and fame. Example: The most-liked and respected project manager in
the organization says, “I think we should change the content of our standard project charter.”
NOTE: The best forms of power are expert and reward. Penalty power is generally the least effective. Formal,
reward, and penalty are powers derived from your position in the company. Expert power is earned on
your own.
On the exam, expect questions that describe a situation and then ask what you should do. The options
might include solutions using various forms of power. You’ll then need to select the best answer based on
the situation presented. To answer these questions, know that penalty is generally an incorrect choice, but
make sure it isn’t the most appropriate choice for the particular situation described.
CUTIﬂlCt Management
Many situational questions on the exam describe conﬂicts. Therefore, to be
able to pick the best choice from many "right” answers, you should understand different conﬂict resolution
techniques and be able to determine which one is best for the situation described.
First, let’s think about conﬂict. Is it bad? Should we spend time preventing the root causes of conﬂict?
Who should resolve the conﬂict?
Try to answer the questions just posed. Get them right, and you are likely to do well on this part of the
exam. The answers are:
i No, conﬂict is not inherently bad.
' Yes, it is important to identify and deal with the root causes of conﬂict.
' Conﬂict should be resolved by those who are involved, possibly assisted by the project manager.
Although we often think conﬂict is bad, it actually presents opportunities for improvement. This is
another topic many people have a different understanding about than what is supported by currently
accepted research. Make sure your basic thinking about conﬂict is on the new side and not the old, as
shown in the following table.
Old
New
Conﬂict is dysfunctional and caused by personality Conﬂict is an inevitable consequence of

TRICKS
When you have questions on the exam relating to conﬂict management, make sure you think:
OF THE
”Who generally has responsibility for (and authority over) the situation described in this
TRADE
question?” 3 ”What resolution of this problem would best serve the customer’s interests?”; and
”What is the urgency with which I need to solve the conﬂict?” Would it be best to let everyone cool down
or is this something that must be resolved immediately? What would happen if you didn’t get involved
versus involving yourself?
Know the following conﬂict resolution techniques for the exam. Notice that some have more than one
title; you should know both.
Collaborating (problem—solving) With this technique, the parties openly discuss differences and
try to incorporate multiple viewpoints to arrive at a consensus. Collaboration leads to a win-
win situation.
Compromising (reconciling) 'Ihis technique involves ﬁnding solutions that bring some degree of
satisfaction to both parties. This is a lose—lose situation, since no party gets everything. Did you know
that compromise is not the best choice, but rather second to collaborating?
Withdrawal (avoidance) With this technique, the parties retreat or postpone a decision on a prob-
lem. Dealing with problems is a PMI-ism; therefore, withdrawal is not usually the best choice for
resolving conﬂict, though there may be situations where it is necessary.
Smoothing (accommodating) This technique includes making some concessions, and it empha-
sizes agreement rather than diﬂ'erences of opinion. It does not result in a permanent or complete reso-
lution of the conﬂict.
Forcing (directing) This technique involves pushing one viewpoint at the expense of another. It is a
win-lose situation.

Based on Leas’ model, when a team is in conﬂict, you should ﬁrst take some time to observe the situ—
ation and make sure you are seeing both sides of the dispute. This means, at ﬁrst, you simply listen to the
complaints without immediately trying to solve them. Feel the energy of the group and assess the level of
conﬂict. Look for glances, eye rolling, and words that halt conversations to ascertain if the conﬂict is out in
the open or if it is playing out below the surface.
One way to determine the level of conﬂict is to focus on the language the team is using and compare
it to Leas’ description of the ﬁve levels. Take a look at the table again. What sort of language would you
expect to hear in a Level 2 conﬂict? How about a Level 5 conﬂict?
Level 2. might sound something like this:
I know you think my idea won’t work as well, but we tried your approach last time, and there were a lot of
problems.
Level 5 would be much more combative:
It’s as or them. We have to beat them!
After observing and diagnosing the level of conﬂict, you can decide what to do about it. If the conﬂict
is at Levels 1 through 3, do net take any immediate action to res elve it. Instead, ﬁrst give the team a chance
to ﬁx it themselves. If the team can overcome the conﬂict on their own, they will have developed and
exercised their own skills for resolving conﬂicts. It is okay for them to have some discomfort during this
process, because that will better equip them to manage similar conﬂicts in the future. However, if the
situation doesn’t improve and instead seems to be escalating, the following guidelines can be useful in
resolving the conﬂict:
Level 1 (Problem to Solve): Try constructing a collaborative scenario to illustrate the competing
issues and use that scenario to help build consensus around a decision that everyone can supp ort.
Level 2 (Disagreement): Conﬂict resolution typically involves empowering the relevant team
members to solve the problem. This approach builds the team members’ support for the decision
and restores a sense of safety to the group.
Level 3 (Contest): The conﬂict has become accusatory. To help ﬁx the issue, we need to accommo-
date peeple’s diﬂering views. Although this may involve compromising on the work to be done, we
should not compromise the team’s values.
Level 4 (Crusade): Resolving this level of conﬂict requires diplomacy. Since the communications
between opposing sides have largely broken down, the team may need a facilitator to convey
messages between the different parties. Our focus should be on de-escalating the conﬂict to take it
down a level or two.
Level 5 (World War): Conﬂict at this level may be unresolvable. Instead of trying to ﬁx it, we may
need to ﬁgure out how we can give people ways to live with it. At this level we might separate the
opposing individuals to prevent further harm to each other.
Remember, conﬂict is normal and inevitable when people work closely together. Project managers
often feel obliged to help resolve a conﬂict. However, before rushing in, it is best to observe the situation to
get a better view of the issues. Leas’ model can help us objectively assess the severity of a conﬂict. Pay
attention to the language being used and give the team an opportunity to resolve the conﬂict themselves. If
you do need to intervene, focus on de—escalating the problem by separating facts from emotions and look
for ways to help people move forward despite their differences.

Note that the exam can have made-up terms and processes as answer choices. But remember, if you
are well trained in project management and you see a term on the exam that you do not recognize, chances
are it is not the right answer!
OUIDUIS DI Manage Team
Plans for releasing team members are included in the resource management
plan. Because the length and focus of assigned work varies, team members may be released at different
times throughout the project, as their work is completed. Whenever it occurs, release of team members is
considered a part of this process.
As an output of this process, change requests may be needed to reﬂect changes in resource assignments,
costs, schedule, or any other part of the project management plan or project documents. Examples include
changes to plans for recognition and rewards, or newly identiﬁed needs for team training.
The issue log and lessons learned may be updated based on results of team management efforts. In
addition, the existing systems for human resource management appraisals and evaluations may be updated.
Control Resources
While the PMBOK‘E’ Guide categorizes the control and management of physical resources as a process
separate from that of managing people, can you see how this process might also ﬁt within the process
described above as “acquire and release resources”? The ECO addresses this process in the Process domain
together with human resources management in task 5, Plan and Manage Budget and Resources. The bottom
line is the project manager and team must ensure that the physical resources assigned to the project are
available when they are needed—in the right place and in the right quantity.
In this process, the project manager also monitors the amount, costs, and quality of resources being
used, and compares that to what was planned. If there are any discrepancies between the planned versus
actual utilization, corrective action may be necessary.
Remember the concept of integration and how project processes are related. Imagine a team of
construction workers arriving on site only to ﬁnd that the building materials and construction equipment
have not yet arrived. A resource issue like this could impact not only the plan for resource management, but
also those for schedule and cost, and potentially scope and quality.
The resource management plan indicates how physical resources should be acquired, utilized,
controlled, and released. Other inputs to assist the project manager in controlling resources include project
documents, agreements and contracts, and work performance data—all of which are discussed in the
following sections.
Project Documents Use the following project documents to determine how you will control resources.
' Impediment board Speciﬁc to adaptive teams, this visual tool allows the team to track issues and
risks associated with the project.
' Issue log This document provides information about current issues regarding resource usage on the
project. Issues might include availability (over— or underdsupply), usage (more resources or less
resources being used than what was planned), quality discrepancies, and cost overruns related to
resource usage.
' Lessons learned register The project manager may be able to beneﬁt from previous project experi-
ence with resource control efforts and from historical lessons learned from other similar projects.

The Five CS OI Communication
Certain qualities of written communication enhance the likelihood
that communications will be correctly interpreted and understood by the recipients. The following quali—
ties should be incorporated by the project manager to ensure that messages are effective:
' Correct grammar and spelling
' Concise and well-crafted
' Clear and purposeful
' Coherent and logical
' Controlled ﬂow of words and ideas
Communication
MOdBIS
Many of us do not think systematically about our communications. For
example, we may just send an email and expect that it will be read and interpreted properly. The most basic
communication model only ensures that a message has been delivered, but excellent project communica-
tion requires a more complete approach to communications.
A more comprehensive communication model, interactive communication, includes three main
components: the sender, the receiver, and the conﬁrmation that the message is correctly understood. Each
message is encoded by the sender and decoded by the receiver. The receiver acknowledges receipt of the
message, and both the sender and receiver are responsible for conﬁrming that it has been properly
interpreted by the receiver.
Factors such as working with different languages and cultures are important, but even the receiver’s
perception of the message, everyday distractions, or a lack of interest can affect the way the receiver decodes
a message. Communication models often refer to these types of factors as ”noise” because they can interfere
with the receiver’s ability to understand the message.
More complicated communication models exist, and different models maybe appropriate for different
projects or components of a single project. Keep the interactive model of communication, as shown in
ﬁgure 10.2, in mind when answering communications questions on the exam.


Communications
T E N
352
TR|CKS
Effective Listening
So what should a receiver do during in-person communication to
accurately decode a message and conﬁrm it has been understood? The receiver should pay
attention to the sender’s gestures and facial expressions, and try to focus on the content of the
message without distraction. It’s also important that a receiver practices active listening. Active listening
means the receiver conﬁrms they are listening, accurately reﬂects back on the speaker’s remarks, expresses
agreement or disagreement, and asks for clariﬁcation as necessary.
Communication Blockers‘
Like noise in a communication channel, blockers can range from a lack of
cultural sensitivity to a failure to provide concise messages. Blockers cause miscommunication and can lead
to disagreement and confusion. The exam has often included one or two questions that ask, "What can get
in the way of communication?” or “The following has occurred; what is wrong?” The correct answer
may include:
' Noisy surroundings
' Language
' Distance between those trying to communicate
' Culture
' Improper encoding of messages
Communication Technology
Communications can take place in many ways: face-to—face, over the
phone, in writing, through instant messaging, and via email. These means of communicating are collec-
tively referred to as communications technology. A key aspect of planning communications is determining
the optimal technology with which to communicate information. Agile emphasizes more face-to—face com-
munication, while more formal written communications are necessary when utilizing a predictive approach.
You can use the following list of questions to determine the appropriate technology based on the situation:
' Would it be better to communicate this information in person or virtually?
' Would it be better to communicate the information through an email or a phone call?
'I What technology is the team familiar and comfortable with?
' How quickly and how often does the information need to be communicated?
' Are there security or conﬁdentiality issues that should be considered when choosing a means of
communicating information?
' Would a letter sent through the mail get more attention?
It’s also important to consider the complexity of the information that needs to be communicated.
Alistair Cockburn developed a communication effectiveness model that compares common communica—
tion methods in terms of their effectiveness and their richness, or ”temperature.”2 Figure 10.3, which is
based on Cockburn’s model, maps two key factors—interactivity and information density—for several
communication technologies. This concept is especially important in agile environments where complex
information is communicated in less formal methods. Interactivity and information density on this model
indicate a communication technology’s ability to transfer complex information e ”’iciently.
In the ﬁgure, paper—based communications are the lowest in terms of interactivity and information
density. Written documents take a long time to create and, because they are not interactive, the documents
have to be written in such a way that all project stakeholders can understand the information, regardless of
their level of knowledge or expertise. Pap er documents are also low in bandwidth, so they typically do not
convey the writer’s emotional tone, feelings about the information, or implicit assumptions.

Bandwidth/information Density
FIGURE 10.3 Information transfer efﬁciency via technology
At the other end of the scale, face—to—face communication at a whiteboard has the highest e "iciency.
Here, the participants (such as the project team, for example) can both converse and draw their ideas on the
whiteboard. They can use shortcuts for well—understood concepts to speed the exchange of information,
and they can ask each other questions and get immediate feedback. Such conversations convey a lot of
emotional bandwidth through nonverbal communication such as gestures, facial expressions, and tone of
voice. Face—to-face communication allows for the most information to be transferred in a given period of
time, but it is less convenient than other forms of communication. Can you see how this approach would
be helpful for the project team, but may be impossible with all of the stakeholders on a project? Think about
how you would use this model for your real—world projects.
TRICKS
As you read this chapter, you may come across many new terms. You can learn most of these
terms without memorization as long as you understand that project communications
requirements for all stakeholders must be collected, analysed, and accounted for on an
ongoing basis. And while face—to-face communication is often most effective, we also often work with
dispersed teams. For example, can you guess what n‘push communication” might be before reading the
next section?
communication MBthOdS
When planning communications, it’s also important to determine the
communication method. These methods can be group ed into the following categories?
It Interactive communication This method is reciprocal and involves two or more people. One person
provides information; others receive it and then respond to the information. Examples of interactive
communication include conversations, phone calls, meetings, instant messaging, and video calls.
" Push communication This method involves a one-way stream of information. The sender provides
information to the people who need it but does not expect feedback from the recipients. Examples of
push communication are status reports, emailed updates, blogs, and company memos.
' Pull communication In this method, the sender places the information in a central location. The
recipients are then responsible for retrieving the information from that location. This method is often
used to distribute large documents or to provide information to many people.

Communications
a team of 300 people located in different countries, speaking different languages, and with diverse
approaches to communication that are inﬂuenced by their culture. A small project may be accomplished
entirely from one location. It is critical to thoroughly plan communications but to also tailor that planning
effort depending on the project.
In hybrid environments, for example, project managers communicate some project information
through both predictive and agile methods. Leaders of agile teams in hybrid environments must often
produce weekly status reports, update Gantt charts, and create earned value reports in addition to tracking
agile metrics, like throughput and velocity. Also keep in mind that an important role of a project manager
is to protect the team, which will allow them to operate in a more agile way.
Many project managers fail to recognize not only the impact of communications on a project but also
the complexity of sharing information. When we teach communications in our Project Management Tricks
of the Trade” class, this topic is one that most people are not initially interested in, yet they ﬁnd the
communication activities we offer in class to be some of the most valuable.
I"'I
This topic is important on the exam. It shouldn’t be di icult for you—as long as you feel comfortable
recognizing the type of project from the information in the question and answering accordingly. A basic
concept is that communications should be eﬁicient (providing only the information needed), effective
(providing information in the right format at the right time) , and should add value to the project. Think
about your real—world communications. Do you do the following?
' Ask people what information they need and when.
' Tailor standardized communication practices within your organization to project size, complexity,
life cycle, and development approach.
' Use multiple methods of communicating.
' Plan how you will conﬁrm communication is received and understood.
' Realize that communication go es in multiple directions, to and from people at all levels, and internal
and external to the organization.
' Analyze how factors such as location, culture, security, privacy, and language will impact
communications on the project.
' Plan communications for each stakeholder or group based on individual needs and interests.
' Have a system for storing, maintaining, and retrieving project information.

ments altogether.
Use the following information to determine and analyse communication requirements:
' Stakeholder register
' Locations of stakeholders
' Stakeholder personas
' Numb er of communication channels
'
Stakeholder engagement plan
Finalizing Communications Planning
As a result of planning on your project communications, you
should have a documented description of the communications needs of stakeholders and a strategy to meet
those needs. Components of this plan may include what communications should be prepared, dissemi-
nated, and received among all project stakeholders, how communications should be named and stored,
who has access to the communications, who has the ability to edit communications, and who has respon-
sibility for sending and receiving project communications. The plan may also include tailored approaches
related to language and cultural differences, and may have information on how the effectiveness of project
communications will be evaluated.
Because communications are so complex, a communications management plan should be in writing
for most projects. Figure 10.4 shows some of the considerations for what you might include in
communications planning.

project information is available. In a similar way, agile emphasizes collaborative planning, estimating, and
retrospectives, which allows the project team to have and share key project information.
Information Radiatorsg Information radiator is an agile term for highly visible displays of information,
including large charts, graphs, and summaries of project data. These tools, sometimes referred to as visual
controls, are usually displayed in high-trafﬁc areas to maximise exposure, where they can quickly inform
stakeholders about the project’s status.
Data displayed on an information radiator may include:

RBII‘OSDBC’IWB Findings Retrospective ﬁndings may also be included on an information
radiator. In hybrid environments, retrospective ﬁndings serve as an ongoing lessons learned
log. Project managers in this environment are expected to gather and produce lessons learned
reports at the end of the project, so they often build this content using the project’s retrospective ﬁndings.
Teams in hybrid environments usually hold retrospectives that gather information and ideas on how
processes are performing and what experiments should be run. This information can be very useful for
generating ﬁnal lessons learned artifacts.

tions plan provides details on how to measure the effectiveness and e ’"iciency of communications. If you’re
not familiar with data collection and evaluation techniques, you’ll need to think about how you would use
them on a large project and how they may diﬁer on other types of projects.
This process involves measuring to determine whether the communications management plan is
being followed, conﬁrming communications and feedback are understood, and whether communications
are meeting the needs of the stakeholders. If not, you need to identify where communication is breaking
down, and adjust as necessary to meet those needs. How can you tell if communication is breaking down?
In addition to the metrics you’ve established, you may rely on soft skills as an alternative approach.
Encourage stakeholders to tell you whether the project communications are meeting their needs. Project
stakeholders may let you know, for example, if they’re not getting the reports or information they’re meant
to receive. Or you’ll be informed if the project team isn’t following-up on action items established through
earlier communications. Do you encourage this type of feedback on your projects?
As mentioned earlier, you should ask stakeholders for feedback on project reports and other
communications they receive. Also, project team members should report any communication problems
they experience and help to identify ways communications can be improved on the project.

The project has 13 team members and affects more than 15 departments in the organization. Because
the project is 2.0 percent complete to date and the team has had successful performance reports from
ﬁve of the affected departments, the project manager holds a party to celebrate. The project manager
invites key stakeholders from all of the departments to the party in order to give those providing good
reviews an informal opportunity to communicate good things to these departments that have not yet
been aﬁected by the project. At the party, the project manager walks around to try to discover any
relevant information that would help her make the project even more successful. She happens to hear
a manager of one of the departments talking about setting up more regular meetings on the project.
The best thing for the project manager to do would be to ﬁrst:
Record the effectiveness of the party in the project lessons learned.
Review the effectiveness of the project’s communications management plan.
Hold a meeting of all the stakeholders to discuss their concerns.
Make sure the manager has a copy of the communications management plan so that he is
reminded that such concerns should be sent to the project manager.

The requirements of many stakeholders were not approved for inclusion in your project. Therefore,
you had a di "lcult time gaining formal approval of the project management plan. The stakeholders
argued and held up the project while they held meeting after meeting about their requirements. The
project was ﬁnally approved and work began six months ago. All of the following would be good
preventive actions to implement except:
A. Keep a ﬁle of what requirements were not included in the project.
B. Make sure the change control process is not used as a vehicle to add the requirements back into
the project.
C. Maintain an issue log.
D. Hold meetings with the stakeholders to go over the work that will not be added to the project.
The sponsor has suggested that your agile team skip the in-person demo meetings and just send the
product owner a link to try out the latest increment of working software. She says that will give your
team more time to deliver value. You want to explain the importance of an in—person demo meeting
with the product owner. What will you say?
A. An in-person meeting helps ensure that the product owner will weigh their feedback carefully
and not ask for any unneeded rework.
B It usually takes more time to set up and test a virtual communications tool than to meet in person.
C. The team needs to see the product owner’s body language and facial expressions to understand
what they really want.
D. The team will be able to address the product owner’s needs better if they can have a conversation
and ask questions.
The project manager is expecting a deliverable to be submitted by email from a team member today. At
the end of the day, the project manager contacts the team member to notify him that it has not been
received. The team member apologizes and explains that he was not able to email the deliverable, and
it was sent through the mail instead. The team member goes on to remind the project manager that he
had informed the project manager during a phone conversation that this would occur. "Was that the
conversation we had when I told you 1 could not hear you well due to poor cell phone coverage?” asks
the project manager. “Yes,” replies the team member. What could have been done to avoid this problem?
A. Verbal communication

E L E V E N
The assumption log, cost forecasts, the lessens learned register, the project schedule, project team
assignments, the risk register, and the risk report are all project documents that may be updated as an
outcome of planning risk responses. The risk report is updated to communicate the risks of greatest threat
or opportunity, the overall project risk exposure, and the outcomes of planning related to risk responses
and any anticipated changes. Can you imagine how risk response planning might affect the roles and
responsibilities on a project, your stakeholder management strategy. or your quality metrics?
RlSk Register Updates
The risk register is updated to add the results of risk response planning,
including:
' Residual risks115 These are the risks that remain after risk response planning. After you have avoided,
exploited, mitigated, enhanced, transferred, shared, escalated, and accepted risks (and created related
contingency plans and fallback plans), there will still be risks that remain. Those residual risks that are
passively accepted should be properly documented and reviewed throughout the project to see if
their ranking has changed.
' Contingency plans Contingency plans are plans describing the speciﬁc actions that will be taken if
the opportunity or threat occurs.
' Fallback plans These plans are speciﬁc actions that will be taken if the contingency plans are not
effective. Think how prepared you will feel if you have plans for what to do if a risk occurs and what to
do if the original plan does not work.
' Risk owners A key concept in risk response planning is that the project manager does not have to do
it all, and neither does the team. Each risk must be assigned to someone who will help lead the devel—
opment of the risk response and who will be assigned to carry out the risk response or “own” the risk.
The risk owner can be a stakeholder other than a team member. Think about how the application of
risk management could change real—world projects. The risk occurs; the risk owner takes the pre-
approved action determined in project planning and informs the project manager. No meeting is
needed—just action! This can be very powerful.
' Secondary risks Any new risks created by the implementation of selected risk responses should also
be analyzed as part of risk response planning. Frequently, a response to one risk will create the possi-
bility of new risks. For example, if a portion of the project work is outsourced to a seller because the
project team does not have the expertise to complete the work e "’iciently, there may be a secondary
risk of the seller going out of business. The discovery of secondary risks may require additional risk
response planning, including ensuring that the secondary risks are of a lower severity than the pri—
mary risk.
1' Risk triggers” These are events that trigger the contingency response. The early warning signs for
each risk on a project should be identiﬁed so risk owners know when to take action.
' Contracts Before a contract is ﬁnalized, the project manager should have completed a risk analysis
and included contract terms and conditions required to mitigate threats and enhance opportunities.
Any contracts issued to deal with risks should be noted in the risk register.
' Reserves (contingency)JIE Having reserves for time and cost is a required part of project manage—
ment. You cannot come up with a schedule or budget for the project without them. Reserves are
covered in the “Cost” chapter, but let’s look at them again here.
Time and cost each have two types of reserves: contingency reserves and management reserves.
Contingency reserves account for “known unknowns” (or simply "knownsi’h these are items you identiﬁed
in risk management. Management reserves account for ”unknown unknowns” (or simply "unknowns”);
these are items you did not or could not identify in risk management. Projects can have both kinds of
reserves. As shown in the diagram in ﬁgure 1 1.5 (also shown in the “Cost” chapter), contingency reserves
are calculated and become part of the cost baseline. Management reserves are estimated (for example, 5
percent of the project cost), and then these reserves are added to the cost baseline to get the project budget.
The project manager has control of the cost baseline and can approve use of the contingency reserves, but
management approval is needed to use management reserves. The same applies to reserves in the schedule.

E L E V E N
Make sure you understand that reserves are not an additional cost to a project. The risk management
process should result in a decrease to the project’s estimated time and cost. As threats are eliminated or
their probability or impact reduced, there should be a reduction to the project’s schedule and budget.
Contingency reserves are allocated for the contingency plans and fallback plans to deal with the associated,
accepted opportunities and threats that remain after the risk management planning processes have been
completed. No matter what you do, risks will remain in the project, and there should be a time or cost
allotment for them, just as time or cost is allotted to work activities on the project.

FIGURE 11 .5
Contingency and management reserves create a cast budget
There may be questions on the exam that ask you to calculate the contingency reserve for several risk
events, which may be a combination of opportunities and threats. To do this, you must calculate the value
of each risk using the equation for expected value (P X I). On the exam, you may have to calculate
contingency reserves for either schedule (expected value) or cost (expected monetary value). But think
about this a minute. Let’s use the example for cost impacts to projects. Can you just add all the expected
monetary value amounts of the opportunities and threats together and come up with one grand total for
the budget? No! You’ll need to subtract the total expected monetary value of the opportunities from the
total expected monetary value of the threats. Why?
Opportunities will save money and time on the project if they occur. This can reduce the cost or
schedule baselines. Conversely, the threats will add cost and time to the project.
You’re being told to subtract opportunities here, but weren’t you told earlier that expected value is
often presented as a positive amount for opportunities and a negative amount for threats? That’s often true
when the values are depicted on something like a decision tree, so you can easily identify positive and
negative outcomes and their overall effect on project costs or schedule. But this example is speciﬁcally
looking to determine how much money or time to set aside for the contingency reserves. Threats will
require increasing the amount of contingency reserves, whereas opportunities will decrease the
required reserves.

A quick note on approaching and adjusting a risk backlog” from an agile perspective. In an agile
environment, a project’s backlog is prioritized not just for features but for the risk responses that have been
developed for identiﬁed risks. In planning each iteration, agile teams seek to balance delivering the highest—
value features and mitigating the biggest threats that remain on the project. The backlog can now be referred
to as a ”risk-adjusted backlog,” as illustrated in ﬁgure 11.6.

You are nearing the end of the “Plan Risk Responses” section. Let’s examine some important concepts
for the exam in this group of questions and answers. Take a few moments to test yourself.
Question
What do you do with noncritical risks?
Answer
Document them in a watch list, and revisit them periodically.
Question
Would you choose only one risk response strategy?
Answer
No, you can select a combination of choices.
Question
What risk management activities are done during the execution of the project?
Answer
Watching out for watch—listed (noncritical) risks that increase in importance, and
looking for new risks; implement contingency plans if triggers indicate the risk is
about to occur or is occurring.
Question
What is the most important item to address in project team meetings?
Answer
Risk.
Question
How would risks be addressed in project meetings?
Answer
By asking, "What is the status of risks? Are there any new risks? Is there any change to
the order of importance?”
Implement Risk Responses
PAGE 449
Implementing risk responses is the heart of risk management, and where the value of proper risk
management becomes most apparent. When the preliminary work has been done well, the Implement Risk
Responses process can be handled smoothly, since the previously documented plans allow for timely and
effective responses to risk events.
Throughout the project, the risk register and risk report are reviewed regularly, ensuring everyone is
aware of potential risks and ready to implement the planned responses as needed. Information on triggers
enables the project manager, risk owner, and team to re co guise indications that a risk event is imminent. At
that point, the risk owner, supported by the project manager, leads previously assigned resources in
performing response activities. The consequences of threats are averted, or opportunities are taken
advantage of. Risk thresholds?” are documented in the plan along with an indication of what amount of
relief is required from risk responses, so the success of the implementation can be evaluated.
The beginning of this chapter included the story of a project manager who was managing a hardware/
software installation during a hurricane. Let’s revisit that example.
If the project manager had performed prop er risk management, he would have had a plan in place to
avoid the risk of a hurricane impacting his project, for example, scheduling the project to happen before or
after the forecasted hurricane. If the project manager and the risk owners had actively monitored known
risk triggers (such as weather reports, including wind speeds and the projected path of the hurricane) and
then implemented a risk response plan before the hurricane reached the area, they could have successfully
avoided the rework and delays, along with the costs, resulting from the hurricane. Such preparation is
critical to successfully implementing a risk response.
Sometimes carefully developed plans don’t have the expected result. For example, let’s assume that a
risk owner or the project manager in the previous story implemented a risk response plan to reschedule the
implementation, causing the schedule to be extended. Although the plan was executed as intended, the
hurricane caused more damage than anticipated, and the schedule had to be extended beyond the planned
number of days. Such unforeseen results are managed through change requests to the cost and schedule
management plans.

E L E V E N
Project documents are updated as a result of the Implement Risk Responses process. The risk register
and risk report are updated with information on responses taken, details on how well the responses
addressed the risk and suggested changes to future risk response plans. The project manager adds
information to the lessons learned register about what worked and what didn’t work when the risk response
was implemented. The risk report is updated with changes to the project’s risk exposure and changes to
planned risk responses. Ongoing issues, such as confusion or disagreement regarding the response as it was
implemented, are added to the issue log.
Monitor Risks
PAGE 453
—
Risk—related questions on the exam assume that the project manager has done proper project management,
including assigning risk owners, putting contingency plans in place, and taking actions as outlined in the
plan. The exam also assumes the project is substantially less risky with this planning done. If you do not
have experience using risk management in the real world, these exam questions may be di ”lcult. Try the
next exercise. It will help you understand what project management is like when it includes risk management.
11.6 Exercise Think about the previous paragraph. Because a project manager has completed
risk management activities, they are no longer focusing on dealing with problems and ﬁguring out
what should be done. So what is the project manager doing?
Spend time really thinking through the actions involved in monitoring risks and write them
down in your Exercise Notebook. Once you have completed your list of actions, compare that to
our list. You could include things on your list that are not on ours, but check each one of those items
to determine if they are accurate. If there are items on our list that you didn’t include, then make
sure you do these actions or at least understand what they are and why they are helpful to the
project.
Answer With risk management and proper project management, you are not doing things like
ﬁguring out what work needs to be done on the project or determining who will do a piece of work.
Those efforts were already done in project planning. You are not spending much time solving
problems, because you already have a plan in place for major problems. Even well-trained and
experienced project managers do not always do enough to monitor risk. Read the following list
over carefully, and make sure you understand each of the actions. This is not a time for memorization;
you are simply assessing what you know and do not know so that you can better understand these
concepts and correctly answer situational questions on the exam.
Keep in mind that in an agile or hybrid environment, a project manager may accomplish this
in a less formal manner than in a predictive environment. You may update risk burndown charts,
review risks in a retrospective, and ask the project team how plans to reduce threats and maximize
opportunities are going. Do you need to create any new stories to address new or escalating risks?
Do you need to engage the product owner in discussions about reprioritizing the backlog based on
new risk information?
The following is our list of actions involved in monitoring risks in a predictive environment.
i Look for the occurrence of risk triggers.
' Monitor residual risks.
' Identify new risks and then analyze and plan for them.
' Evaluate the effectiveness of the risk management plan. Is it working? Does it need adjustment?
' Develop new risk responses. If a plan no longer seems like it will work, based on experience
or new information, an alternate risk response or responses may be more appropriate.

' Collect and communicate risk status: ”Four identiﬁed risks occurred last month, and all risk
response plans were implemented successfully. Next month eight other risks may occur. Risk
reserves are still considered adequate for covering the identiﬁed risks on this project.”
' Communicate with stakeholders about risks: ”Remember that one of the major risks on the
project could occur next week.”
I Determine if assumptions are still valid.
' Ensure proper risk management procedures are being followed.
' Revisit the watch list: ”This change to the product scope might increase the impact of risk X,
currently on our watch list. Let’s analyze it.”
i Recommend corrective actions to adjust to the severity of actual risk events: ”This risk did
not have the impact we expected ; let’s adjust the contingency plan and change what we will
do if the risk reoccurs.”
' Look for any unexpected effects or consequences of risk events: ”We did not expect this risk
to damage the construction site. We need to decide how to ﬁx the damage after we ﬁnish
implementing the already agreed-up on contingency plan.”
' Reevaluate risk identiﬁcation and qualitative and quantitative risk analysis when the project
deviates from the baseline: ”The project cost is over the cost baseline (or over the schedule
baseline). This implies we missed some major risks. Let’s hold another risk identification
session.”
1' Look at the changes, including recommended corrective actions, to see if they lead to
identifying more risks: ”We keep having to take corrective action related to this problem.
Let’s look for the root cause and identify any risks to the remainder of the project that relate
to the problem.”
' Submit change requests to integrated change control.
' Update the project artifacts with approved changes and any relevant information from the
analysis of work performance data.
' Create a database of risk data and lessons learned that may be used throughout the organiza—
tion on other projects
' Perform variance and trend analysis on project performance data.
' Use contingency reserves and adjust for approved changes.
" Update the risk register and risk report with current risk exposure.
' Reevaluate assumptions and constraints, capture new issues, and up date existing ones.
'
Close out risks.
Other work that is part of the Monitor Risks process is outlined in the following sections.
Workarounds
If the project has deviated from the baselines, the team may take corrective action to bring
it back in line. Recommendations for such corrective actions may include workarounds. Whereas contin—
gency responses are developed in advance, workarounds are unplanned responses developed to deal with
the occurrence of unanticipated events or problems on a project (or to deal with risks that had been
accepted because of unlikelihood of occurrence and/ or minimal impact). Project managers who do not
perform risk management spend a lot of their time creating workarounds.
RlSk HBEISSBSSITIBI’I’IS
Questions always seem to come up on the exam that require you to know that the
team needs to periodically review the risk management plan and risk register and adjust the documentation
as required. It is important to determine whether any changes or adjustments need to be made to what was
planned based on information that becomes apparent once work begins. Reassessing risk is a good topic for
a team meeting, a retrospective, or even a separate meeting, as part of risk reviews. Many of the actions in
the previous exercise relate to this.

As with other risk management processes, change requests, updates to any
project management plan component, the risk register, risk report and other project documents are a result
of Monitor Risks, along with additional outputs listed here.
WDl‘k Performance Information
This is the analysis of the work performance data gathered as part of
project control. Examples include results of risk reviews and audits, performance measurements on
schedule progress, determinations of which risks can be closed or are likely to close in the near future, and
variance analyses comparing the planned versus actual risk data and time and cost of implemented risk
responses. In agile and hybrid environments information is exchanged in a daily standup meeting about
new accomplishments as well as impediments, and is documented through an updated backlog and burnup
and burndown charts.
RlSk Register Updates
The Monitor Risks process will add the following to the risk register:
' Outcomes of risk reassessments and risk audits
' Results of implemented risk responses
' Updates to previous parts of risk management, including the identiﬁcation of new risks
' Closing of risks that are no longer applicable
' Details of what happened when risks occurred
' Lessons learned
to determine whether the actual work of the project has begun. You will have to determine
what efforts are generating the change requests to help you evaluate answer choices. If the work
of monitoring risks is being performed, new risks may be identiﬁed or planned risk responses may need
to be adjusted based on project knowledge or an evaluation of risk processes. As a result of approved
changes, risk planning must again be performed appropriately, and new risks must be evaluated and
ranked, which may result in more risk response planning. This will generate change requests to integrated
change control. The trick here is to remember that the approved project management plan and baselines
are not static but changes to them must go through integrated change control.

## You are iterating the project management plan and will be meeting with the sponsors to get approval.


There have been some problems on recent projects because the projects were started quickly and it was
assumed that there would be few challenges. You know the sponsors will want assurances that this
project will not have similar issues. You have evaluated the approach and have planned the project,
including how you will manage risk, in order to deliver a better outcome. You have a few minor risks
on the watch list. What, if anything, should be done with those risks?
Document them for historical use on other projects.
Document them and revisit them during project monitoring and controlling.
Document them and set them aside because they are already covered in your contingency plans.
Document them and give them to the customer.

Customized Contracts
On adaptive projects, project managers may use different types of contracts to
create a customized contract that meets the needs of both the buyer and the seller. With such contracts, the
customer retains ﬂexibility to reprioritiae work, and the seller is not penalized for sharing information
about increased costs. Customized contracts also remove the incentive for the seller to add large contingen-
cies to the project price.
Customized contracts can be highly beneﬁcial to both parties, but you should understand that creating
a contract between one party who wants to minimize the cost of a product or service and another party
looking to maximize their revenue will always be a balancing act. On agile projects, procurement
management is particularly challenging, since the details of the scope can’t be fully deﬁned earlier in the

T w E L v E
Procurement
I Ceiling pricelr This is the highest price the buyer will pay; setting a ceiling price is a way for the buyer
to encourage the seller to control costs. The ceiling price is a condition of the contract that must be
agreed to by both parties before signing. Keep in mind that answers to calculations on the exam can
change when a ceiling price is mentioned.
' Point of total assumption (PTA)3 This only relates to ﬁxed price incentive fee contracts, and it
refers to the amount above which the seller bears all the less of a cost overrun. Costs over the PTA are
assumed to be due to mismanagement: a design statement of work should have been created to allow
fer fair and reasonable contract negotiations for the required work, suggesting the seller either did net
estimate correctly or did net manage the work well. Sellers will sometimes monitor their actual costs
against the PTA to make sure they are still receiving a proﬁt fer completing the project.

' Nendisclesure Agreement For many procurements, there is a great need for conﬁdentiality. Such a
written agreement between the buyer and prospective sellers identiﬁes the information or documents
they will control and held conﬁdential; it also details who in the organization will have access to the
conﬁdential information. With a nondisclosure agreement in place, the buyer can talk more openly
about their needs without fear that the public or one of the buyer’s competitors will gain access to
the information.
' Standard Contract Commonly created by the buyer, standard contracts are usually drafted—er at
least reviewed—by lawyers and generally do net require additional review if used for the purpose fer
which they were intended. You should understand standard contracts, but also realize the project
manager’s role in special provisions (described next).
' Special Provisions (Special Conditions) The project manager must understand standard terms and
conditions but also determine when additions, changes, or deletions from the standard provisions are
required. By facilitating necessary adjustments, the project manager can make sure the resulting
centract addresses the needs of the project. The project manager (remember when taking the exam
that you are the buyer’s project manager, unless a question states otherwise) meets with the
procurement manager (if there is one) to discuss the needs of the project and to determine the ﬁnal
contract terms and conditions.
Additions, changes, or deletions are sometimes called special provisions and can simply pertain to
the type of project and project requirements, risk analysis and administrative, legal, or business needs.
' Letter of Intent In some instances, the seller may need to start hiring people or ordering equipment
and materials before the contract is signed in order to meet the contract requirements. A letter of
intent is not a contract, but simply a letter stating that the buyer intends to hire the seller. It is intended
to give the seller conﬁdence that the contract will be signed seen and to make them comfortable with
taking the risk of ordering the equipment or hiring the staff that will eventually be needed.
' Privity Privity simply means a contractual relationship. The following explains privity and shows
how questions on this topic may be asked.
Question
Company A hires company B to do some work. Company B subcontracts to
company C. The project manager for cempanyA is at the job site and tells company
C to stop work. Generally, does company C have to listen?
Answer
No. Companies C and A have no contractual relationship. Company A needs to
talk to company B, who needs to talk to company C.

Can you see how this would be important to understand? Any directive that the project manager from
company A may give to company C can cause liability for company A. For example, companyA may have
to pay delay claims to company B, plus the costs of delay to company C if company C stopped work at
company As direction.
Terms ﬂﬂd CDI‘IditlDﬂS
There are many terms and conditions associated with procurements that may be
considered. Let’s start out with a story to better understand some of these terms and conditions.
A project manager (the buyer) needed his team members trained on some equipment. He contacted
a seller to do the work and then had his procurement department send them a contract. Meanwhile, he
arranged for team members to travel for the training. There were terms and conditions in the contract that
said the buyer would have rights to create derivative works and copy handouts from class. The handouts
were proprietary and already copyrighted. The seller could not and would not sign the contract. The class
had to be cancelled while many people were already on planes to attend the training. Whose fault was this?
The project manager should have made sure the procurement department understood what they were
buying and also should have looked at the contract before it was sent to make sure its language was accurate.
Creating a contract requires the involvement of both the project manager and the procurement manager.
Do you work with a procurement manager to review contracts on your projects?
Terms and conditions (either standard or special) differ depending on what you are buying. For
example, for buying work that includes equipment you need terms that describe when ownership will be
transferred to the buyer and terms that require insurance for damages in transit. For professional services
you need terms requiring professional liability or errors and omissions insurance. These terms are usually
determined by the procurement manager, but the project manager should be familiar with most
common terms.
The following are categories of terms and conditions that can make up standard or special provisions.
Be familiar with these concepts and what impacts they would have on a contract. The exam will often
simply use these terms in sentences such as, “There was a force majeure,” and you’ll need to understand
what that means (force of nature, like a ﬂood or a ﬁre). Conversely, you need to know that “There was a
ﬂood that made the seller unable to perform,” describes a force majeure.
' Acceptance How will you speciﬁcally know if the work is acceptable?
' Agent Who is an authorized representative of each party?
' Arbitration This method to resolve disputes uses private third parties to render a decision on the
dispute. Arbitration is paid for by the parties and is used because it is usually faster and cheaper than
the courts.
' Assignment This refers to the circumstances under which one party can assign its rights or obliga—
tions under the contract to another.
It Authority Who has the power to do what?
' Bonds These are the payment or performance bonds, if any, that must be purchased. For example, a
payment bond would protect the buyer from claims of nonpayment by the seller.
It Breach} default This occurs when any obligation of the contract is not met. Watch out—a breach on
the seller’s part cannot be ﬁxed by a breach on the buyer’s part. For example, failure to complete an
item in the procurement statement of work (seller’s breach) cannot be handled by the buyer stopping
all payments (buyer’s breach).
A breach is an extremely serious event. The exam may present situations in which seemingly little
things in the contract are not done. The response to a breach must always be to issue a letter formally
notifying the other party of the breach. The project manager must understand the legal implications
of their actions. If they do not watch out for and send an o "i cial notice of breach, the project managers
company could lose its right to claim breach later.
' Changes How will changes be made? What forms will be used? What are the tirneframes for notice
and turnaround?

T w E L v E
Procurement
Confidentiality/ nondisclosure What information must not be made known or given to
third parties?
Dispute resolution How will any disputes regarding the contract he settled? Some options for dis-
pute resolution are to use the courts or an arbitrator.
Force majeure This refers to a situation that could be considered an "act of nature,” such as a ﬁre or
freak electrical storm, and it is an allowable excuse for either party not meeting contract require—
ments. If a force majeure occurs, it is considered to be neither party’s fault. It is usually resolved by the
seller receiving an extension of time on the project. Who pays for the cost of the items destroyed in a
ﬁre or other force majeure? Usually the risk of loss is borne by the seller and is hopefully covered by
insurance. (See also “Risk of loss” below.)
Incentives These are beneﬁts the seller may receive for achieving the buyer’s objectives of schedule,
cost, quality, risk, and performance.
Indemnification (liability) Who is liable for personal injury, damage, or accidents?
Indep endent contractor This term means the seller is not an employee of the buyer.
Inspection Does anyone have a right to inspect the work during execution of the project? Under
what circumstances?
Intellectual property Who owns the intellectual property (for example: patents, trademarks, copy-
rights, processes, source code, or books) used in connection with or developed as part of the con-
tract? This may include warranties of the right to use certain intellectual property in performance of
the contract.
Invoicing When wi‘l invoices be sent? What supporting documents are required? To whom are
they sent?
Liquidated damages These are estimated damages for speciﬁc defaults, described in advance.
Management requirements Examples of management requirements include attendance at meetings
and approval of staff assigned to the project.
Material breach This breach is so large that it may not be possible to complete the work under
the contract.
Notice To whom should certain correspondence be sent?
Ownership Who will own the tangible items (such as materials, buildings, or equipment) used in
connection with or developed as part of the contract?
Payments When will payments be made? What are the late payment fees? What are reasons for
nonpayment? Watch out for questions regarding payment management. For example, as a response
to inaccurate invoices, the buyer cannot stop all payments ; this would be a breach. They can, however,
stop payments on disputed amounts.
Procurement statement of work If it is not a separate document, this will be included as part of
the contract.
Reporting What reports are required? At what frequency? To and from whom?
Retainage This is an amount of money, usually 5 percent or 10 percent, withheld from each pay—
ment. This money is paid when the ﬁnal work is complete. It helps ensure completion.
Risk of loss This allocates the risk between the parties to a contract in the event goods or services are
lost or destroyed during the performance of a contract.
Site access This describes any requirements for access to the site where the work will be performed.
Termination Termination is stopping the work before it is completed.
Time is of the essence Delivery dates are strictly binding. The seller is on notice that time is impor-
tant and that any delay is a material breach.

' Waivers These are statements saying that rights under the contract may not be waived or modiﬁed
other than by express agreement of the parties. A project manager must realize that they can inten-
tionally or unintentionally give up a right in the contract through conduct, inadvertent failure to
enforce, or lack of oversight. Therefore, a project manager must understand and enforce all aspects of
the contract, even if a procurement manager is involved in administering the contract.
' Warranties These are promises of quality for the goods or services delivered under the contract, usu-
ally restricted to a certain time period.
' Work for hire The work provided under the contract will be owned by the buyer.
IHGBHIIVBS
Sellers are usually focused on the proﬁts, while buyers may be focused on cost, performance,
schedule, or a combination of these. Incentives are used to bring the seller’s objectives in line with the
buyer’s and to motivate the seller towards e "lciency. Think of an incentive as a bonus for the seller. The
buyer will provide an additional fee if the seller meets some cost, performance, or schedule objectives.
Can you see how incentives can change the focus of the seller’s work?I If there is an incentive for cost
savings, then the work is to complete the project and to look for cost savings. If the incentive is for some
increased level of performance (the system can handle more capacity than contracted for, for example),
then the work is to complete the project and to look for ways to increase performance. The seller gains
proﬁt from both activities.
Now that you understand the concepts, it is time to work through some examples. You may need to
calculate incentives for the exam. As you do the following exercises, notice the terms "cost,” "fee,” and
“price.” These terms all have different meanings, as deﬁned previously.
12.3 Exercise In this cost plus incentive fee contract, the cost is estimated at $210,000, and the
target fee is set at $25,000. The project is complete, and the buyer has agreed that the costs were, in
fact, $200,000. Because the seller’s costs came in lower than the estimated costs, the seller shares in
the savings: 80 percent to the buyer and 20 percent to the seller. In your Exercise Notebook,
calculate the ﬁnal fee and ﬁnal price.
Target cost
$210,000
Target fee
$25,000
Target price
$235,000
Sharing ratio
80/ 20
Actual cost
$200,000
Answer Remember that for the exam you may have to calculate both the ﬁnal fee and the
ﬁnal price.
$210,000 - $200,000 = $10,000
FInaI Fee
$10,000 x 20% = $2,000
$25,000 target fee + $2,000 = $27,000 fee
Final Price
$200,000 + $25,000 + $2,000 = $227,000

I Risk register

' Procurements already in place
Fer procurement, enterprise environmental factors include marketplace conditions, the services that
are available to be purchased, and the existing culture and structures surrounding the organization’s
approach to procurements. Relevant organizational process assets can include procurement procedures
and documents, standard contract types used by the organization, statement of work templates, lessens
learned from past procurements and projects. A preapproved (or prequaliﬁed) seller list and master service
agreements, if they exist, are also useful.
A preapproved seller list speeds up the process by helping ensure the sellers’ qualiﬁcations are well
researched. The procurement documents are sent only to the preapproved sellers. Master service agreements
are contracts between two parties including standard terms that will govern future transactions — a time—
saving approach when a buyer frequently works with the same seller because overall terms of working
together are already agreed to and signed by both buyer and seller.
Make-or-Buy Analysis During planning, you must decide whether the scope and work of the project
will be completed within the organization or if some if it will be outsourced. It’s important to ask questions
such as, ”How are resources currently distributed?” and “What are the capabilities of our resources?” Make-
or-buy analysis is done early in the planning phase of the project, and results in a make—or—buy decision.
LDntS ﬂﬂd Supply Chain Management An important consideration in make-or-buy analysis is the
required lead time for materials and equipment to be purchased. Specialty items, custom products, and
items ordered internationally will take more time, which must be built into the project schedule.
ECDHDITIiC Models
Economic models similar to those used in project selection and deﬁned in the
"Integration" chapter may support make-or—buy decisions. Examples include payback period, ROI, IRR,
return, discounted cash ﬂow, and (NPV).
Expect to see questions on the exam that refer to make—or—buy analysis, or even questions that require
you to calculate buy-ordlease situations, such as:
Question
You are trying to decide whether to lease or buy an item. The daily lease cost is $ 120.
To purchase the item, the investment cost is $1 ,000; the daily maintenance cost is
$20. How long will it take for the lease cost to equal the purchase cost?
Answer
Let D equal the number of days when the purchase and lease costs are equal.
$120D = $1,000 + $201)
$12013 — $201) = $1,000
$1001) = $1,000
D=10
The calculation says that the costs are the same after 10 days. Therefore, if you are planning to use the
item for fewer than 10 days, you should lease. Otherwise it would be cheaper to buy the item.
SOUI‘GB Selection Analysis
Project constraints are factors in seller selection. For example, is schedule
the most important criteria or is cost the critical factor? You may want to review the project constraints in
the “Framework” chapter.
Other source selection criteria” are used and, as in project constraints, some are often weighed more
heavily over others. If the buyer is purchasing a commodity, such as linear meters of wood, the source
selection criteria may just be the lowest price. Ifthe buyer is procuring construction services, the source
selection criteria may be price plus experience. If the buyer is purchasing services, the source selection
analysis criteria may include:

Procurement
I Expertise (e.g., software design or legal services): Your procurement SOW includes functional andx’
or performance requirements, a timeline, evaluation criteria, and required meetings, reports, and
communications.
' The construction of a building: Speciﬁc requirements, outlining things such as the materials to be
used, the process that must be followed, and work schedule.
' Augmenting your staff: You will direct these human resources so you will need details of what you
want the person to create or achieve.
Note: If the procurement is for services rather than pro ducts, the procurement SOW may be referred
to as terms of reference (TOR). It includes the work the seller will perform, standards the seller is expected
to achieve, and the data and services that will be provided to the buyer.
The procurement statement of work may be revised during contract negotiation, but it should be
ﬁnalized by the time the contract is signed as it is part of the contract. Both parties to the contract should
always be asking, "What does the contract say?” Ifthe procurement SOW is not complete, the seller may
frequently need to request clariﬁcation or ask for change orders, which can get expensive, and the project
manager andf or the procurement manager may ﬁnd themselves constantly dealing with questions about
whether a speciﬁc piece of work is included in the original cost or time estimates.
Think ab out change orders in the context of the procurement strategy and the project plan. In general,
contract change orders cost money or cause delay. Bad procurement SOWs can result in overspending and
delayed or failed projects.
Although they are not speciﬁed in the PMBOKE Guide, there are several types of procurement
statements of work with which you should be familiar. Your choice will depend on the nature of the work,
the industry, and the amount of detail that can be provided about the work. The following are types of
procurement statements of work:
' Performance This type conveys what the ﬁnal pro duct should accomplish, rather than how it should
be built or what its design characteristics should be. For example, "I want a car that will go from zero
to 120 kilometers per hour in 4.2 seconds.”
' Functional This type conveys the end purpose or result, rather than the speciﬁc procedures or
approach. Functional procurement statements of work may include a statement of the minimum
essential characteristics of the product. For example, "I want a car with 10 cup holders.”
' Design This type conveys precisely what work is to be done. It includes the materials to be used and
an explanation of how the work should be completed. Design procurement statements of work are
most commonly used for construction and equipment purchases. For example, “Build a garage exactly
as shown in these drawings.”
Fixed-Price Work Packages An alternative option within statements of work are ﬁxed-price work packages.
Fixed-price work packages are used in conjunction with agile contracts to mitigate the risks of underesti-
mating or overestimating project work by reducing the scope and cost involved in the work being esti—
mated. For example, a statement of work can be divided into individual work packages, each with its own
ﬁxed price. Then as project work progresses, a supplier may be able to re—estimate the remaining work
packages in the statements of work based on new information and new risks.
Using ﬁxed-price work packages allows the customer to reprioritixe the remaining work based on
evolving costs. It also gives the supplier the ability to update their costs as new details emerge, removing the
need for the supplier to build excess contingency funds into the project cost. The changes are then localized
to small components (the work packages). If extra funding is required, it is easy to identify the need and
justify it. The ﬁgurebelow illustrates the difference between a traditional 30W and ﬁxed-price work p ackages.

Note that the proposed contract is included in the procurement documents. Do you know why? The
terms and conditions of the contract are also work that needs to be done, and there are costs associated
with that work, including such things as warranties, ownership, indemniﬁcation,
and insurance
requirements. The seller must be aware of all the work that needs to be completed to adequately understand
and price the project.
Well-designed bid documents can have the following effects on a project:
' Easier comparison of sellers’ responses
' More complete responses
' More accurate pricing
' Decreased number of changes to the project
Sellers may make suggestions for changes to the procurement documents, including the procurement
statement of work and the project management requirements included in the documents, before the
contract is signed. When approved, these changes are issued by the buyer as addenda to the bid documents
and will ultimately become part of the ﬁnal contract.
Noncompetitive Forms 0f PI'DCUI'E'I‘I'IBI'I’I Public organizations are generally required by law to follow certain
practices regarding competitive procurements and to select a seller in a certain way. Although they might
have internal policies to follow, private companies may bypass competitive procurement by using master
service agreements or preferred seller lists, in which case they could simply issue a purchase order to obtain
goods or services from an approved or preferred seller.
If you do not use a competitive process, you enter one of the following types of noncompeti-
tive procurements:
' Sole source In this type of procurement, there is only one seller who can provide the goods or ser-
vices. 'Ihey may own a particular patent.
' Single source Here, you contract directly with your preferred seller without going through the full
procurement process. You may have worked with this company before, and, for various reasons, you
do not want to look for another seller. In some cases, there may be a master service agreement in place
between an organization and this seller: an established, ongoing contract.
Other reasons for working with a company as a single source are:
i The project is under extreme schedule pressure.
i A seller has unique qualiﬁcations.
" Other mechanisms exist to ensure the seller’s prices are reasonable.
' The procurement is for a small amount of money.
If you are entering a noncompetitive procurement, you may save time by eliminating part of the
process that comes before bidding but you still have to negotiate to ﬁnalize the contract.

Once your make-or-buy analysis and procurement strategy are complete and you have selected the
contract type, completed a statement of work and bid documents you are prepared to engage with
prospective sellers. You will send the bid documents and supporting documentation, answer the sellers”
questions, possibly hold a bidder conference, and evaluate sellers’ responses. You will select a seller using
your source selection criteria and then negotiate a contract.
Conduct Procurements
PAGE 432
Managing procurements includes carrying out the ﬁnal strategy for ﬁnding a seller and negotiating and
ﬁnalizing a contract with them. Information from the project management plan including to-date baselines
and other planning documentation will assist in this process with prospective sellers and in making a ﬁnal
decision for each procurement. Because the process to ﬁnalize procurements is ongoing throughout the
project, you and the team may be able to make use of lessons learned from prior procurements on the
current project or previous projects, which can provide insight into the organization’s experiences with
sellers. This information can often streamline the process considerably.
A buyer may use tools and techniques such as advertising to ﬁnd possible sellers or may send the bid
documents to a select list of sellers preapproved by the organization (an organizational process asset). The
organization may already have an existing agreement with a particular seller. In this case, they could work

buyer is a public entity and the response is to an invitation to bid, the answer is simple. The work goes to
the lowest responsive, responsible bidder. In the case of a proposal, the selection decision is more compli-
cated. The buyer will apply the selection criteria chosen in planning. But which is more important? Price?
Competence? Availability? Selection criteria are assigned values based on their relative importance to the
procurement. For example, if price is more important, it will be given a higher rating and weight. The
buyer’s evaluation committee then analyzes seller responses using the weighted source selection criteria.

PﬂSt Performance History
The buyer may consider both their history with the prospective sellers and
feedback from other organizations who have done business with the sellers when determining which seller
to award the procurement to.
Independent COSl Estimates
The buyer should compare the seller’s proposed cost with an estimate
created in—house or with outside assistance during procurement planning efforts. This allows the buyer to
discover signiﬁcant differences between what the buyer and seller intend in the procurement statement of
work. The buyer must have their own estimates to check reasonableness and cannot rely solely on the sell—
er’s cost estimates. Responses that are signiﬁcantly different from what is expected may indicate an issue
with the sellers’ understanding of the procurement statement of work.
Presentations
In many cases, some of the sellers will be asked to make presentations of their proposals.
This is often a formal meeting of the buyers and seller’s teams. It provides the seller with an opportunity to
present their proposal, team, and approach to completing the work. The buyer has an opportunity to see
the team they may hire and to ask questions to assess the team’s competency. Presentations are used most
often for procurements that have cost-reimbursable contracts, but they can be used whenever there is a lot
to assess.
NBQDtlﬂliDl’lS
The exam typically has a question or two related to contract negotiations and the project
manager’s involvement. You do not have to be an expert negotiator to pass the exam. But, as you have seen
in other chapters of this book, the ability to negotiate is an important interpersonal skill for a project
manager. Although the procurement manager generally leads negotiations, the exam assumes the project
manager is involved. There are often negotiating issues that aﬁect the key objectives of the project or how
the project will be managed. Without the project managers’ involvement in negotiations, it is common for
a contract to be signed that the project managers later discover cannot be completed.

It is important enough to state again that contracts may be ﬁnalized after other project plans are
completed and approved. This could trigger the need for changes to any part of the overall project,
potentially including the scope, schedule, or cost baselines (to address availability or cost of procured
resources), or any other planning document components such as quality, resources, communications or
risk plan components. The preapproved seller list may also be updated based on work done in Conduct
Procurements.
Managing Procurements
PAGE 492
—
Managing a procurement once the contract is signed involves managing the legal relationship between the
buyer and seller, and ensuring that both parties perform as required by the contract and that each contract
is closed when the project is completed or terminated. The li’il/LBOICa Guide calls this Control Procurements,
but note again that the ECO considers the entire procurement process be included within the Plan and
Manage Procurement task. The seller is focused on completing the work while the buyer is focused on
measuring the performance of the seller and comparing actual performance to the contract, other
procurement documents, and management plans. The exam tends to ask situational questions focusing on
what happens after the contract is signed, so this process is an important area on the exam.
You should understand what the project manager should be doing at any point in time, and what
problems and issues might affect the management of the project under each contract type. You will need to
ensure that all work and legal requirements in the contract are accomplished however small and
seemingly unimportant.
The procurement management plan includes the actions you and the team will take to oversee
procurements, and you may also review lessons learned to avoid the recurrence of issues experienced in the
past. Approved change requests from integrated change control are implemented in this process.
You will use the milestone list and schedule, scope, and cost baselines to conﬁrm that the project is
progressing as planned. Requirements documentation describes technical and other requirements the
procurement is expected to meet. Quality reports indicate whether the work of the procurement is within
the established quality metrics. Work performance data from the Direct and Manage Project Work process
(in “Integration”) gives the project manager information on costs and the status of project activities, and is
used to evaluate seller performance.
You are continually measuring and assessing project progress as compared to the contract and
procurement documentation and management plans. The tools and techniques described later in this
section include many ways in which this is accomplished. When variances are identiﬁed, they are analyzed
and may need to be managed using the integrated change control system. Approved changes will be
integrated into the management plans or the contract. Contract changes are handled using the organization’s
contract change control system,15 which is an enterprise environmental factor. This system includes change
procedures, forms, dispute resolution processes, and tracking systems, and is described in the contract.
These procedures must be followed, and all changes should be made formally (which means in writing).

I Review invoices. Were they correctly submitted? Do they have all the required supporting
information? Are the charges allowable under the contract?
I Evaluate whether a change is needed and is within the approved scope of the project.
I Submit changes through integrated change control as necessary.
I Document and record everything. This includes phone calls with the seller, emails, requested
changes, and approved changes.
I Manage and integrate approved changes.
I Authorize payments to the seller.
I Interpret what is and what is not in the contract.
I Interpret what the contract means.
I Resolve disputes.
I Make sure only authorized people are communicating with the seller.
I Work with the procurement manager on requested and approved changes and contract
compliance.
I Hold procurement performance review meetings with your team and the seller.
I Report on p erformance— this means your own performance as well as the seller’s p erfo rm an ce.
I Monitor cost, schedule, and technical performance against the contract, including all of its
components, such as terms and conditions and the procurement statement of work.
I Understand the legal implications of actions taken.
I Control quality according to what is required in the contract.
I Issue claims and review claims submitted by the seller.
I Authorize the seller’s work to start at the appropriate time, coordinating the seller’s work with
the work of the project as a whole.
I Communicate with the seller and with others.
I Manage interfaces among all the sellers on the project.
I Send copies of changes to the appropriate parties.
I Accept veriﬁed deliverables.
I Validate that the correct scope is being done.

The tools and techniques that can be used to manage procurements include performance reviews,
inspections and audits , earned value analysis , and trend analysis. Performance reviews include analyzing all
available data to verify that the seller is performing as they should. Often, the seller is present to review the
data and to discuss what the buyer can do to help advance the work. Together they determine if changes are
needed to improve the buyervseller relationship, the processes being used, and how the work is progressing
compared to the plan. Any changes must be agreed upon in writing.

T w E L v E
Procurement
Inspections may involve walkthroughs of the work site or deliverables reviews to verify compliance
with the procurement statement of work. Do deliverables meet speciﬁcations? Variances or deviations may
trigger change requests. An audit is performed by a team that includes representatives of both the buyer and
the seller. The audit is to conﬁrm that the seller’s activities comply with approved procurement policies and
processes. Variances are identiﬁed, formal adjustments are made accordingly, and lessons learned are
captured. Note that in agreement with what we say in the “Quality” chapter, inspections are related to
deliverables while audits are related to processes, policies, and procedures.
Earned value analysis measurements identify scope, schedule, or cost variances from the performance
measurement baseline. Variances are analyzed to determine their impact on the project. The results maybe
used to generate reports, forecast future performance, and predict actual completion dates and costs.
Change requests may be made based on these results. Trend analysis determines whether performance is
getting better or worse. It can be used to determine if preventive actions can prevent signiﬁcant variances in
the future and to develop forecast estimates and estimate at completion.
Contract Interpretation and Managing CDHIIIC’I
Contract interpretation is never easy and frequently
requires a lawyer’s assistance. However, the exam may describe a simple situation about a conﬂict over inter—
pretation of a contract and then ask you to determine the correct answer.
Conﬂict is an important topic that may be addressed in tricky procurement questions. In many cases the
procurement manager (or contract administrator) is the only one with authority to change the contract. We
have also said that the contract includes the procurement 80W The buyer’s project manager may want to
initiate a change to the scope or sequence of work identiﬁed in the procurement SOW (an area seemingly
under the project manager’s control), but cannot do so without the procurement manager’s approval. This
adds another layer to the project manager’s management activities that you may not have seen if you do not
work with procurements. Can you see the potential for conﬂict between the procurement manager and the
project manager?
Conﬂict can also occur between the buyer and the seller and may result in the seller submitting a claim
against the buyer. A claim is an assertion that the buyer did something that has hurt the seller. The seller is
now asking for compensation. Another way of lo oking at this is that a claim is a type of seller-initiated change
request. Claims can get contentious. Imagine a seller that is not making as much proﬁt as they had hoped
issuing claims for every action taken by the buyer. Inlagine the number of claims that can arise if you are
working with a ﬁxed-price contract and an incomplete procurement statement of work.
Claims are usually addressed through the contract change control system. The best way to settle them is
through negotiation or the use of the dispute—resolution process speciﬁed in the contract. Many claims are
not resolved until after the work is completed.
TRICKS
Contract interpretation is based on an analysis of the intent of the parties, as reﬂected in the
OF THE
language of the contract, along with a few guidelines for interpreting that language. One such
TRADE
guideline is that the contract supersedes any memos, conversations, or discussions that may
have occurred prior to the contract signing. Therefore, if a requirement is not in the contract, it does not
have to be met, even if it was agreed upon prior to signing the contract. The following is an exercise
on intent.

The outputs of managing procurements are change requests, procurement document updates, and
closed procurements. Change requests to a contract result when the buyer’s needs change while the work
is underway, the impacts of the contract changes having been negotiated by the two parties. Contract
changes may be requested throughout the procurement process and are handled as part of the project’s
integrated change control efforts, along with all other project changes. Like other project changes, contract
changes need to be analyzed for their impacts on all project constraints.
You should be aware of the concept of constructive changes, which do not result from formal change
requests. Rather, constructive changes occur when the buyer, through actions or inactions, limits the
seller’s ability to perform the work according to the contract. This can include over-inspection or failure to
hold up their end of the contract (e.g., failing to review documents or inspect deliverables on time). A
simple direction to the contractor to perform certain work that may seem minor can result in a constructive
change that adds costs if that change is outside the scope of the contract.
Throughout the process of managing an active procurement, data on the contract and contract
performance by both the buyer and the seller is gathered and analyzed. Because a contract is a formal, legal
document, thorough records must be kept. A records management system maybe used to keep procurement
documentation complete, organized, and accessible. Record keeping can be critical if procurement-related
actions are questioned after the procurement is completed, such as in the case of unresolved claims or legal
actions. Records may also be necessary to satisfy insurance requirements. For many projects, every email,
every payment, and every written and verbal communication must be recorded and stored. On other
projects, information about the weather and the number of people on the buyer’s property each day maybe
recorded. On large or complex projects, a records management system can be quite extensive and can
re quire a person just to update it, including indexing, archiving, and information retrieval systems.
Finally, procurements are closed as they are completed or terminated. All procurements must be
closed out, no matter the circumstances under which they stop, are terminated, or are completed. Closure
is a way to accumulate some added beneﬁts, such as lessons learned. It provides value to both the buyer and

necessary to minimize problems and miscommunications with the seller(s).
Identify risks and incorporate mitigation and allocation of risks into the contracts to decrease
project risk.
Help tailor the contract to the unique needs of the project while it is being written.
Include adequate time in the project schedue to complete the procurement process.
Be involved during contract negotiations to protect the relationship with the seller.
Protect the integrity of the project and the ability to get the work done by making sure the

Stakeholder Analysis
PAGE 507
The ﬁrst stakeholders are likely those who identify a problem or need. They maybe involved in developing
business documents for a project to provide a solution. The business case and beneﬁts management plan,
created before project initiating, may include lists of stakeholders who will beneﬁt from or be affected by
the project. An ongoing, focused effort to identify stakeholders should continue from this point throughout
the project.
Why is it so essential to identify all stakeholders? Any stakeholders who are missed will likely be found
later. When they are discovered, they will probably request changes, which may cause delays. Changes
made later in the project are much more costly and harder to integrate than those made earlier. Identifying
all stakeholders helps to create a project that considers all the interests, inﬂuence, and interdependencies of

stakeholders. That said, changes within a project or organization may introduce new stakeholders, or a
project manager may simply miss stakeholders in the initial identiﬁcation. It’s important, therefore, to
reassess the list of stakeholders throughout the project to determine whether new ones should be added
and, if so, what that will mean for the project.
Many project managers fail to consider the bread range of potential stakeholders. Remember,
stakeholders are any people or organizations whose interests may be positively or negatively imp acted by
the project or its product, as well as anyone who can exert positive or negative inﬂuence over the project.
This diverse group can include the sponsor, the team, senior management, subject matter experts, end users
of the product or service, other departments or groups within the organization, functional or operational
managers, sellers, consultants, regulatory agencies, customers, ﬁnancial institutions, and many more. If the
project includes procurements, the parties to the contract(s) are also stakeholders.
Keep in mind that you don’t need to do the work of identifying stakeholders alone. The project team
should be involved in this process. You can also consult subject matter experts, project managers in the
organization who have worked on similar projects, and professional associations. And as new stakeholders
are identiﬁed, they may be able to suggest other stakeholders to add to the list.
The following tools and techniques can be used during the Identify Stakeholders process (which
includes a complete stakeholder analysis).
Questionnaires and Surveys Stakeholders, team members, and subject matter experts may be asked to
name other potential stakeholders and to provide input regarding management of particular stakeholders
or stakeholder groups.
Brainstorming and Brain V‘friting1 Participants may take part in brainstorming sessions to help identify
additional stakeholders. Brain writing is an individual effort, while brainstorming involves a group of
people interactn and working together.
Stakeholder Analysis There are many factors to consider when analyzing stakeholders. Consider their
roles and responsibilities on the project, as well as their level of authority and inﬂuence within the organiza-
tion. Every stakeholder has expectations and attitudes toward the project that must be uncovered. You must
also determine how interested they are in the project. What is at stake for them?
Examples of stakes include the following:
— Ownership The stakeholder may have to sell property for the new freeway expansion that
is proposed.
— Knowledge The stakeholder maybe the expert who designed a legacy inventory management
system that is being replaced.
— Rights The stakeholder may be concerned that the new development will endanger the
community by destroying the watershed.
— Rights A government ofﬁcial may be responsible for ensuring that the safety practices on the
construction site comply with state and federal laws.
I.
— Interest The community may be concerned that additional tra lc will come into their resi-
dential neighborhood if the new commuter rail stop does not have adequate parking facilities.
— Contribution The resource manager may be concerned that resource team members assigned
to the project will not be able to complete their normal operational work with the addition of
project work.
Document Analysis Using this technique involves assessing all project documents and reviewing any les-
sons learned as well as other historical information (organizational process assets) from past projects. This
analysis can be used to identify stakeholders and to collect information about the stakeholders and their
stakes in the project.

’Ihe stakeholder register is an important input to the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process, as well as
to several ether planning processes, including Plan Communications Management. Remember that the
register will be added to and updated throughout the life of the project.
Personasﬁ Personas are quick guides of key stakeholders on the project and their interests. Agile software
projects, for example, commonly create personas for the different types of people who will use the system
that is being built. Personas may be based on proﬁles of real people or composites of multiple users. When
they are used as a project tool, personas should:
' Provide an archetypal description of users
' Be grounded in reality
' Be goal-oriented, speciﬁc, and relevant
' Be tangible and actionable
'
Generate focus
Personas help keep stakeholders’ values and needs in mind during the project. Agile teams often use
personas to focus the project on delivering the features that users will ﬁnd valuable, which leads to better
decision making on the project.
Finally, remember that there are many outputs that are common to many or all knowledge areas, such
as change requests and project management plan and document updates. For example, a project
management update particular to stakeholders is the stakeholder register, while you of course could also
have changes to the stakeholder engagement plan.
Plan Stakeholder Engagement
PAGES 515 and 523
Managing the impact, relationships, and engagement of the stakeholders identiﬁed and analyzed during
the previous process is essential to project success, but it can take a lot of time. That’s why it’s so important,
as is the case with much of project management, to think and plan ahead before taking action.
Stakeholders can be an asset or a problem on the project, depending on how well the project is
planned. To eifectively manage relationships with this many people, you need to develop a stakeholder
engagement plan. You need to think ahead about how the project will impact stakeholders, how you and
the project team will interact with stakeholders, how you wil' involve stakeholders in making decisions,
how you will manage their expectations, and how you can keep them satisﬁed—to ensure they are an asset
on the project.
Planning stakeholder engagement requires you to strategize about your approach to stakeholder
involvement, and develop actionable plans. This means you should schedule time to get to know your
stakeholders and to check in with them throughout the project. If you know your stakeholders well, you’ll
have more success engaging them and will be better able to predict what engagement will look like
throughout the project. Only through ongoing stakeholder engagement can the project manager and team
be conﬁdent they will deliver the expected end result.

FIGURE 13.5 GulfofEucluctiou
The gulf of evaluation? (as shown in ﬁgure 13.6) is so common because it is easy for mismatches to
arise between what one person envisions and tries to describe and how another person hears and interprets
that description. If the mismatch is left unchecked for too long, costly rework or project failure can (and
often does) result.
Now you may be thinking, "I have hundreds of stakeholders on my project, located all over the world.
How can I possibly build and maintain relationships with them?” This is exactly why you need a plan. You
may not be able to have a close relationship with every stakeholder, but you can’t aﬂbrd not to have
relationships with key stakeholders and as many project team members as you are able. It’s also important
for you to plan ways in which you and your team members can develop relationships with stakeholders who
are not a part of the project team.
Keep in mind, the closer you are to stakeholders, the more comfortable they will be to come to you
with problems and concerns, and the easier it will be for you to pick up on verbal and nonverbal cues that
can tell you when something might be wrong. This can be an early warning system for problems on your
project. How do you build positive and powerful relationships with your stakeholders? The same way you
have built them with your friends and family: by spending time getting to know them and allowing them to
get to know you. The more time you spend with someone, the better you’ll be able to ascertain their
impressions and concerns.
What are the characteristics that deﬁne a good relationship? Take a few minutes to think about this.
Draw on your experience with your family, friends, coworkers, and others. You may come up with diﬂerent
or additional qualities, but here are a few potential characteristics of a good relationship:
' Trust
' Respect
' Honesty
' Concern
' Interest
I Empathy
' Sincerity
' Good communication
As you plan how you will get to know your stakeholders, remember that these are the qualities you
want to nurture in your relationships with them.
During planning, you need to determine which stakeholders will require most of your time and effort.
These decisions require you to think about the role of each stakeholder, the environment within which they
operate, and the speciﬁc needs of your project. If there are any procurements in place, you will need to

T H I a T E E N
Stakeholders
coordinate with the procurement department to plan stakeholder engagement efforts related to parties of
the contract.
To plan stakeholder engagement, you will need the details of what has already been planned and
documented in plans including resource and communications management, information from the
stakeholder register, and any relevant information from past, similar projects.
Let’s consider an example. Imagine you are managing a project to replace the online application
process for open positions in your company. Your sponsor is the human resources director, who wants to
streamline the process and encourage candidates with advanced technical experience to apply for jobs.
Even though your stakeholders include anyone who is a potential job candidate (possibly millions of
people), there are a few key stakeholders with whom you will plan to spend most of your time: your sponsor
and the managers in the company who evaluate candidates. As the project team is designing and building
the new website to satisfy stakeholder requirements, you will want to receive frequent feedback from your
key stakeholders about how the design meets their expectations. You might also identify a few newly hired
employees who could help the team understand problems with the existing application process. Your
stakeholder engagement plan might include formal review meetings where you discuss progress and get
feedback on the progress of the website development.
Your experience on other projects and historical records of similar projects can help you anticipate
and plan to meet stakeholder needs on the project. However, you should make use of the expertise of
others as well. If you’ll be working with a stakeholder for the ﬁrst time, talk to another project manager or
team member who knows this person. Meet with professional organizations, consultants, and subject
matter experts to hear valuable insight on working with various stakeholders and stakeholder groups. Ask
questions about how best to work with the stakeholders, and then meet with them as soon as possible to
initiate these important relationships. Make sure the stakeholders themselves understand how important it
is for you to meet their needs, and encourage them to communicate frequently as the planning and project
work proceed. These preliminary meetings and conversations are critical for you to get an impression of
how best to work with each stakeholder.
Not every stakeholder will be as engaged in the project as you might like, and some might be more
engaged than you would wish. Stakeholder engagement can range from unaware of or resistant to the
project to neutral to supportive or even interested in taking a leading role on the project. Think about each
stakeholder’s attitude and interest in the project as this will help you determine the level of engagement
required to make the project successful. You should also consider how much engagement you require from
stakeholders during each phase of the project. You may require some stakeholders to be more involved
during planning, for example, while others will take on a more prominent role during executing. Identify
and analyze variances between the current and desired level of engagement, and work with the team to
identify ways to achieve the right engagement level.
The project manager will need to choose tools and techniques to plan stakeholder engagement that
are appropriate for the project.
Stakeholder Engagement Assessment NlEl’tl'lltB
A stakeholder engagement assessment matrix is a data
representation tool used to compare stakeholders’ current and desired level of engagement (see ﬁgure
13.7). The stakeholder engagement plan documents how adjustments to stakeholders’ level of engagement
will be achieved. This matrix is revisited as the project progresses, to evaluate ongoing stakeholder engage-
ment. Analysis of updates to this matrix may indicate the need to further plan or alter the stakeholder
engagement strategy.

Stakeholder Engagement Plan The result, or output, of planning stakeholder engagement is a stakeholder
engagement plan. The plan documents the existing and desired levels of engagement for all stakeholders,
including plans to achieve the desired levels. It also provides details about ways in which stakeholders will
be involved in the project, and it includes guidelines and metrics for monitoring and evaluating how well
the plan is meeting the needs of stakeholders and the project.
Stakeholder engagement plans generally have a component that addresses how communication
OF THE
will be used on the project to help manage stakeholder engagement and expectations. This
TRADE
means that the stakeholder engagement plan and the communications management plan can
be repositories of some similar information about stakeholder communication requirements and who
needs to receive what information on a project. But the two plans each have a diﬁerent focus. The
communications management plan emphasizes the details about the technology, methods, and models of
communication—the what, when, and how of communication. The stakeholder engagement plan, on the
other hand, explains the why of communications—why stakeholders need to receive certain information,
and how the sharing of that information will help in managing stakeholder engagement and expectations.
As you might expect, portions of these two plans are often created together.
Keep in mind that the stakeholder engagement plan wil' likely require adjustment throughout the
project. We’ve already discussed how you’ll need to reevaluate your list of stakeholders during the project.
The discovery of new stakeholders may require changes to the plan, and there may be changes on the
project that require less or more involvement from various stakeholders.
Be careful with information ab out stakeholders! Taink carefully before you share the stakeholder
engagement plan, your stakeholder register, or other verbal and written communication about stakeholders.
Consider all the potentially sensitive information you might be documenting about stakeholders’ attitudes
and personalities, or obstacles or challenges related to working with a stakeholder. Given how important it
is to maintain good relationships with stakeholders, consider how damaging it would be to your project for
someone to ﬁnd a list of stakeholders along with negative comments about some (particularly if the person
looking at the list is on that list). As the project manager, you always want to maintain a positive attitude
toward your stakeholders, even those who are resistant or di ”icult to work with. A good leader is encour-
aging and supportive of everyone involved with the project. This means that when you discover an obstacle
or challenge associated with a stakeholder, you may decide not to share it with others and not to write it
down: so, small portions of your stakeholder engagement plan may reside only in your mind.
Implement Stakeholder Strategy
PAGE 523
To meet stakeholder needs, resolve their issues, and make sure they remain interested and active in the
project, its essential to encourage stakeholder engagement and manage their expectations. Although this is
an executing process, managing stakeholder engagement is ongoing throughout the life of the project.
When was the last time you did something like the following scenario?
A project manager knows a particular stakeholder is dissatisﬁed because one of his requests was not
included in the scope of the project. The rest of the stakeholders agreed upon the scope, but the project
manager anticipates this person will continue pressing to add his request. The project manager schedules a
meeting with the stakeholder to talk about why this requestwas not a high priority for the other stakeholders
and to suggest this stakeholder build a business case for it being included in another project.
How about this situation?
During requirements gathering, a stakeholder expressed concern about how much the project would
impact her department’s other work. The project manager contacts her to say, ”I have kept your concern in
mind while planning the project. You know there is little probability we could do this project without
impacting your department, but because ofyour concerns, I have put together a report telling you when we

T H I a T E E N
Stakeholders
will impact your department‘fs regular worlc.”fis the project moves forward, the project manager continues
to check in with the stakeholder to discuss any unforeseen impacts.
Or this one?
A project manager notices that a stakeholder who used to provide helpful input regularly has become less
involved in the project lately. The project manager touches base with the stakeholder to say, ”I’ve really
missed getting your feedback on the status reports. I’ve always appreciated your comments. Is there a reason
you’ve been holding back lately? Is there anythingI can do to get you more involved again?”
Why bother doing such work? Such actions are proactive, and let the stakeholders know that their
input is important and that their needs and concerns are being considered, even if they are not agreed to.
These efforts are much more likely to encourage stakeholder support of the project, and also serve the
valuable role of keeping open communication channels with the stakeholders so they can inform the
project manager of potential changes, newly discovered risks, and other information.
Do you think you don’t have time in your real world to do these things? As with many other areas of
project management, such efforts can actually help you be more efﬁcient by reducing the amount of time
you are forced to spend dealing with problems. When taking the exam, assume, unless stated otherwise,
that the project manager has followed the best practices of project management. Therefore, the project
manager has time to continuously encourage stakeholder engagement and manage expectations.
The project manager reviews the stakeholder engagement plan, other management plans, and project
documents, such as the stakeholder register, issue log, and change log, to ﬁnd and address any issues that
could be impacting stakeholder engagement. This review may identify sources of confusion or
misunderstanding. For example, a deferred or rejected change request could decrease the engagement level
of stakeholders who supported the change.
Given how important good communication is to stakeholder management, it’s also critical to follow
the communications management plan. How can you keep people involved and informed if you’re not
communicating with them? Managing stakeholder engagement also requires attention to stakeholders’
needs while work is being done. And it’s essential for the project manager to maintain trust, help resolve
conﬂicts, prevent problems, foster agreement among stakeholders to meet the needs of the project, and
generally encourage stakeholder support of the project and the outcome of the project. This requires the
use of interpersonal and team skills such as political and cultural awareness, negotiating, and
conﬂict management.
It’s important to note a key difference between predictive and adaptive approaches as it relates to
problem solving, conﬂict management, and stakeholder engagement. Traditional project management
tends to rely on the project manager for problem solving and correction, while agile project management
treats this as a whole-team activity. When attempting to resolve threats and issues, organizations often
overlook a great source of potential solutions—the project team.
Involving the team in solving problems has many beneﬁts. One of the most important advantages is
that you gain the team’s buy-in from the start 3 you don’t have to sell your solution to the team. Engaging the
team in problem solving also accesses a broader knowledge base. Team members are often closer to the
details of the project and may bring additional insights unknown to the project manager. Of course, it’s
important to only involve the team when necessary to solve critical problems. Otherwise, you risk getting
in the way of project work.
Managing stakeholder engagement can result in requested changes to the project or product scope as
well as up dates to the stakeholder engagement plan and communications management plan. It can also lead
to updates to project documents, such as the change log and stakeholder register. The issue log may need to
be updated to document stakeholders’ concerns and their ﬁnal resolution. Lastly, lessons learned may be
documented to reﬂect the results of efforts to engage stakeholders.

## Stakeholder


The ﬁrst use of the word “stakeholder” in management literature was in 1963 in an
international memorandum at the Stanford Research Institute. [Robert Y. Cavana and Arun A. Elias,
n‘Stakehelder Analysis fer Systems Thinking and Modelling.” Pap er presented at ORSNZ, Wellington,
New Zealand, December 2000.]
Organizational project management
The concept of organizational project management began in
the information technology sector in the 1930s, within a decade it had become widely popular
throughout management science. [British Standards Institution, Use of Network Techniques in Project
Management: Guide to the Use of Graphical and Estimating Techniques (London: British Standards
Institution, 1984), 1.]
Project management ofﬁce
The development of departments within organizations to manage
projects dates back to the beginning of project management as a discipline. [Frank Parth, Cynthia
Snyder, and Cynthia Stackpele, Introduction to IT Project Management (Vienna, VA: Management
Concepts, 2007), 22.]
Business case
This term has been in wide use for decades , business cases were being written and
studied in the 1920s as part of the scientiﬁc management movement. They became popular in the
1950s after the Harvard Business School began using them as a teaching method. [Michael Davis,
Ethics and the University (New York: Routledge, 1999), 145.
Benefits management plan
The beneﬁts management plan was introduced in the 1990s in the
United Kingdom. The concept spread to the United States in the early 2000s. [Roland Munro andjan
Mouritsen,Accountability: Power, Ethos and the Technologies ofManaging (Stamford, CT: International
Thomson Business Press, 1996) , 133.]
Matrix
These categories were deﬁned in 1971 by Jay R. Galbraith to help organizations improve
their management elﬁciency. [Jay R. Galbraith, “Matrix Organization Designs: How to Combine
Functional and Project Forms,” Business Horizons 14, no. 1 (1971): 29—40.]
Organizational knowledge repository
The concept of the organizational knowledge repository
was created by J. M. An and fellow researchers in 1992, as they began work on early search engines.
The idea was quickly adopted and was common in knowledge management research by the end of the
decade. [J.M. An, R.G. Hung, and G.L. Sanders, "The Role of Domain Coverage and Consensus in a
Network of Learning and Problem Solving Systems,” in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Hawaii
International Conference on System Sciences (Les Alamitos, CA: IEEE Computer Society Press, 1992),

Lessons learned repository
The organization of formal systems to integrate experience into cor-
porate management is a fairly recent development. J. G. March and J. P. Olsen published a paper in
1975 that became the basis for ”organizational learning.” The concept of the lessens learned reposi-
tory was developed by the US military to build on this as part of its 1985 overhaul of contracting
standards; it was disseminated into wider management practice in the 19905. [Department of
Defense, Military Standard Speciﬁcation Practices (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Defense,
1sss)J
Assumption log
The assumption log is a new practice in project management. [John Murdoch et
al, ”Measuring Safety: Applying PSM to the System Safety Domain,” Proceedings of the 8th Australian
Workshop on Safety Critical Systems 33 (2003): 50.]
Constraints Dr. Martin Barnes was the ﬁrst to describe what he called the ”iron triangle” of time,
cost, and output in his course ”Time and Money in Contract Control” in 1969, laying the foundations
for what has become known as the ”triple constraint” (schedule, cost, and scope constraints). [Patrick
Weaver, ”The Origins of Modern Project Management” (lecture, Fourth Annual PMI College of
Scheduling Conference, Vancouver, Canada, April 15—17, 2007).]
Present value, net present value, internal rate of return, payback period, cost-beneﬁt analysis,
opportunity cost, sunk costs, depreciation
These key terms are borrowed from accounting and
economics. The investment of time and money in a project should be reviewed as carefully as the
investment of time or money in any business venture. [Colin Haslam and Alan Neale, Economics in a
Business Content (London: Thomson, 2000).]
Economic value added (EVA)
This term was coined by Thomas B. McMullen in 1997 as a new
label for earlier work by Eliyahu M. Goldratt. [Thomas B. McMullen, Introduction to the Theory of
Constraints (ToC) Management System (Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 1998).]
Law of diminishing returns
This is one of the fundamental principles of modern economics,
developed by David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus in 1815. It has been applied to many ﬁelds of social
science in the two centuries since its discovery. [Mark Skousen, The Making ofModern Economics: The
Lives and Ideas of the Great Thinkers (Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2001), 100.
CHAPTER THREE

## Project life cycle


Dr. Russell Archibald, a founder of PMI, was one of the theorists who reﬁned the
concept of the project life cycle. [R. Max Wideman, The Role of the Project Life Cycle (Life Span) in
Project Management (Vancouver: AEW Services, 2004), 2.]
Development life cycle
The concept of the development life cycle originated in US military con-
tracting during the Vietnam War, inﬂuenced by the lessons learned by NASA during the space race of
the 1950s and 1960s. It spread quickly into IT and general management in the 1970s. [Gerald R.
Holsclaw, ”Integrated Logistic Support—The Life-Cycle Task of Support Management,” Defense
Industry Bulletin 4, no. 2 (June 1968): 1 1.]
Phase gate
The phase gate concept is derived from the ”stage gate” system developed by Robert G.
Cooper in the late 1980s, which underlies most modern waterfall deployment models. [Robert G.
Cooper, ”Stage-Gate Systems: A New Tool for Managing New Products,” Business Horizons 33, no. 3
(May—June 1990): 44.]
Progressive elaboration
The term ”progressive elaboration” has been present in medical science
since the nineteenth century, and was widely popularized during the twentieth century in a variety of
contents. Its use in management science dates to the 1980s, when it evolved from the iterative nature
of computer science. [D.K. I-Iitchins, ”Managing System Creation,” IEE Proceedings-A 133, no. 6
(September 1986): 343.]

CHAPTER FOUR

See note 5 for chapter 3.

## Integration management


The concept of “systems integration management” arose from the highly
technical management requirements of post—World War II engineering projects. By the end of the
19605, integration management was a common term in project management. [Society of Automotive
Engineers, ”Jet Plane Costs Need Not Skyrocket with Performance,” SAE journal, August 1953: 66.]

## Project charter


While the concept of the project charter is very old, it was reﬁned as part of the Six
Sigma methodology. [Penelope Przekop, Sta: Sigma for Business Excellence (New York: McGraw—Hill,
2003), 61.]

## Project management plan


The integration of various project management techniques into a formal
process began in the 19505 with projects coordinated for the US Department of Defense by the
RAND Corporation and Boos Allen Hamilton. [Lauren Keller Johnson, Richard Luecke, and Robert
Daniel Austin, The Essentials of Project Management (Boston: Harvard Business School, 2006), an]

## Baseline


The use of the baseline as a statistical tool dates to the nineteenth century. The word has
been redeﬁned in the contest of management science, although it stil' generaly refers to measure—
ment using numerical or statistical methods. [Harold Kerzner, Project Management: A Systems
Approach to Planning, Scheduling and Controlling (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2001), 1014.]

## Conﬁguration management system Conﬁguration management was ﬁrst developed in the 19505


by NASA. The technique was then borrowed by the US Department of Defense, before it was reﬁned
by private corporations in the 19603. It was originally intended to manage large, complex projects,
such as the design and launch of rockets. [Frank B. Watts, Engineering Documentation Control
Handbook (Norwich, NY: William Andrew, 2000), 10.]

## Work authorization system


The concept of a reﬁned work authorization system evolved from the
PERT methodology of the 19605 and quickly spread from the US federal government to private cor-
porations. [Gregory A. Garrett and Rene G. Rendon, U.S. Military Program Management: Lessons
Learned and Best Practices (Vienna, VA: Management Concepts, 2007), 133.]
'7. Defect repair Defect repair has been a management term for decades. [Barbara M. Bouldin, Agents
of Change: Managing the Introduction of Automated Tools (Old Tappan, NJ: Pearson Education,

NASA, where an Integrated Change Control Board was organised in the late 19705. [Gale Research
Company, Acronyms, Initialisms and Abbreviations Dictionary (Farmington Hills, MI: Gale Research
Company, 1980), 1512.]

## Change control board


The change control board was an important part of the change control
process from its earliest days in the 19705. [John A. Burgess, Design Assurance for Engineers and
Managers (Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 1984), 96.]

Sciences Education Board and National Research Council, Reshaping School Mathematics: A
Philosophy and Framework for Curriculum (Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 1990), 34.]

## Lessons learned register


While the general concept of ”lessons learned” is centuries old, the
lessons learned register is a recent innovation that did not begin appearing regularly in management
literature until the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century. [Jonathan Paul Scopes, "London 2012: A
New Approach to CDM Coordination," Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineering 162., no. 2
(May 2009) .]

## Resource breakdown structure


This concept is related to the work breakdown structure ; like that
concept, it was also developed as part of the PERT methodology. [Gregory T. Haugan, The Work
Breakdown Structure in Government Contracting (Vienna, VA: Management Concepts, 2003), 8.]

## Story point The story point concept originated with Ron Je Tries in the 1990s XP (extreme pro-


gramming) methodology. Kent Beck and Martin Fowler, Planning Extreme Programming, (Boston:
