## time-boxing


Time-boxing will improve your life. At the core it’s simple: assign a fixed period of
time to a task, schedule it and stick to it. It works because it touches on so many
aspects of behaviour: single-tasking and focus to achieve more and feel less stressed,
prioritising work to observe deadlines, frequent feelings of accomplishment, and being
transparent so people can see what you’re doing and help. The tricky bit is chunking
the tasks and estimating how long they’ll take, but this skill improves rapidly with
practice. Key to this is time-boxing into a shared calendar and taking commutes,
meetings, and other commitments into account.

## Prioritise


The modern worker has a thousand things to do at any one time. These should be
ruthlessly and methodically prioritised. Otherwise you’ll consistently add less value at
work. Find ways to avoid being distracted by tasks that jump to the front of the queue
like email and alerts (see below). You also need a system for prioritising tasks – a
simple one will do, and will always be better than none. So list out the tasks you have
and, whether it’s a score out of 10 or colour coding, do it and stick to it.

## Say no


Stop trying to please everyone! It’s much easier said than done, we know, but by
overloading yourself with work, not only do you risk being unable to complete tasks
and meet deadlines – the quality of ALL of your work is affected. Sometimes it’s best
to politely decline so that you can focus on the most important work. If you do it right,
colleagues will understand and respect you for it.

## Move!


Moving does a lot for you. It gets the blood flowing round your body, can break you
out of that daydream and helps stir creative thoughts. It’s good for you and the perfect
tonic to our desk-bound lives. Try a wearable that alerts you when you’ve been inactive
for too long. Or take a walk for that call, or even that meeting.

## Control your devices


Don’t let them control you. We check our phones between 150-221 times a day,
depending on which study you’re reading. Even having your phone in sight, without
touching it, has been shown to reduce performance in tests, according to a study at the
University of Southern Maine. Clear your desk of distracting devices and see how much
more you get done, with fewer distractions.

## Take short breaks


Building regular, short breaks into working time increases focus and productivity,
studies have shown. One popular way to implement this is the Pomodoro Technique,
named for the tomato-shaped timer used by the method’s creator, Francesco Cirillo.
You use the timer to break work up into short periods, usually 25 minutes, with regular
micro-breaks of around 5 minutes. Play around to find what timings suit you best.

## To-do lists


To-do lists are fundamental. They aren’t a complete solution to time management
(time-boxing takes the idea further) but they are essential. Think of a typical day:
we’re rushing around from meeting to email to work conversation to conference call,
picking up countless tasks along the way. We need to log these tasks somewhere and
then ensure that we action them when we finally get a moment of calm. For a lot of
people, the next steps are to prioritise them and then schedule them. But it starts with
to-do lists.

## Eat well


Loading up on sweets and crisps won’t sustain you over hours of hard work, and will
almost certainly result in a crash. This is particularly harmful to productivity as your
brain burns more glucose when trying to exert self-control. Eating foods that slowly
release energy over time is better for your health and productivity. Think unprocessed,
whole foods and a lunch with a balance of protein, veg, fat and carbs.

## 2-minute rule


If a task can be done in less than 2 minutes, don’t write it down or put it into a system
or discuss it or think about it... just do it. Of course if you have a more important,
more urgent job at that same moment, that one will win. But in general we often
procrastinate or feel overwhelmed when sometimes it’s better to just get on with
some small tasks, build momentum, clear the clutter and gain a degree of control. This
works very well for full inboxes, and tends to be more effective when it’s not mixed
with longer tasks. Devote 30 minutes to getting 2-minute jobs done and you will have
completed 15 (at least!)

## Control social media


Taking a sneak peek at what your friends are up to on Facebook during the working
day is common. But social media can be a toxic distraction. One click of a photo can
quickly escalate to 20 and unthinkingly uploading content can get you into trouble.
Take control, don’t let social media control you. Schedule “social media time” into your
calendar for 5 minutes twice a day. By setting aside time to check social media, you can
limit its impact on your day.

## Choose when to check email


Every time we get a ping indicating a new email, comment, or notification of any
sort, our brains get a dopamine hit. Dopamine is the neurotransmitter responsible
for feelings of reward and pleasure, and it can get addictive. This is why it’s so easy
to succumb to constantly checking your emails, as each new message, however
mundane, releases dopamine, at the cost of productivity. Combat this by scheduling
set times to check emails, and allocate other times to producing your best work.

## Organise your workspace


And keep it organised. Spending several minutes excavating the detritus on your desk

orderly work space will make you more efficient and calm and exude an aura of control.
A self-imposed clean desk policy is a good place to start.

## Start earlier


Not easy, but simple and effective. From Richard Branson to Michelle Obama, high

in the day on almost everyone else.

## Breathe


With increasing workloads, varied work, colleagues in multiple timezones and devices
pinging all around us, it’s no wonder we’re a more stressed workforce than any before.
We need simple ways to decompress. Breathing is the simplest. If you feel your mind
buzzing with too many things and it’s spinning out of control... focus on your breath
and try to slow your breathing down a little. Just 90 seconds can be enough to get
you out of the cycle of automatic negative responses and the resulting physiological
reactions. Better still, find 10-15 minutes a day to meditate. Amongst many other
things, meditation helps us to gain better control of our mental meanderings and leads
to happier, more useful and more productive thoughts. Try the Headspace app.

## Turn off alerts


Alerts alert. That means they get your attention. That means they take your attention
from whatever it was you were doing. That’s fine if the alert really is important and
urgent. But for most of us, most of the time, it’s not. The thing we were doing is more
important. So mute alerts, pause them, go into airplane mode. This is about reclaiming
control of where your attention goes, and applies to email, Whatsapp, Slack, Skype,
internal messaging services – everything. Going full-screen (F11 on a PC or ^ + ⌘ + F on
a Mac) is a fast, effective way of muting alerts. Another way is to change your status to
‘Do not disturb’ on your various communications platforms.

## Shorter meetings


The Babylonians created the concept we now call an “hour”, though they probably
didn’t have 21st century business meetings in mind at the time. An hour is a nice,
round number but that’s about all it has going for it as a universal time allocation
for gatherings. Parkinson’s Law says “work expands to fill the time available for its
completion” so if we set aside an hour for every meeting, the meeting will take that
time, though we won’t necessarily get more done than if we had allocated it less time.
So the advice is to either vary meeting length depending on the agenda (and of course
sometimes 60 minutes will be right!) or to universally apply a shorter time, e.g. 30 or 45
minutes. This forces everyone to get the most out of the time you have.

## single-tasking


Do one thing at a time. Do NOT multitask. This is very difficult. Even if you minimise
distractions from devices, tech etc, there are still your dear colleagues who may
approach you. And even if you can isolate yourself from them, there are still the
swirling thoughts in your mind! You’re writing a report, but your brain keeps reminding
you of that task your boss gave you before lunch and that just triggered a series of
thoughts about your last review...aaaggghhh!!! It happens to all of us, so don’t beat
yourself up too much when you get distracted. Just always be clear about what single
task you are supposed to be doing (e.g. have it written somewhere) so you can get back
to it as quickly as possible post-distraction.

## sound & music


Research proves that people who listen to music generally finish their tasks faster
and are better at generating good ideas in comparison to those who don’t listen
to music. However, pop music interferes with information processing and reading
comprehension, so be selective with what you listen to while working, and save the top
40 chart bangers for non-working hours. Instead, try listening to white noise or ambient
sounds, which have been proven to help with concentration. There are plenty of sound
generators out there; try Noisli, a fantastic free background noise generator for both
productivity and relaxation. Great when you need to block out a noisy environment.

## Write it down


The moment you are assigned a task, it looms in your face: big, important,
unforgettable. However, if often does end up being forgotten. Oops! We’ve all been
there. So write it down, make it memorable (hand-drawn visuals, however ridiculous,
are effective) and make tasks stand out somehow so when you come back to your
notes it’s clear what you still have to do. This could be in some task-management
software, a google doc, Word, Notepad, or an actual paper notepad. The important
thing is that you have a written log somewhere.

## Break tasks down


Start with writing down the first thing you need to do, however basic. You’re much
more likely to get started on a task (i.e. not procrastinate), especially on something big,

you avoid overwhelm and maintain momentum, and ultimately execute in a big way.

## 8020 rule


Also known as the Pareto Principle, this rule states that that across all industries,
activities and contexts, 80% of results come from 20% of causes – e.g. 80% of sales
come from 20% of clients; 80% of software problems are caused by 20% of bugs. When
it comes to your work, target the 20% of tasks and actions that will get you 80% of your
results, and you’ll have turbocharged your effectiveness with less effort, minimising
time wasted on low-yield activities.

## be true to yourself


Heed the timeless advice inscribed over the temple of the Greek Delphic oracle: know
thyself. Know your most and least productive times of day, and schedule accordingly.
Know your biggest distractions (Facebook? Compulsive email checking? Chocolate
buttons?) and control for them accordingly. Know your ideal working environment
and try to create it wherever possible. Knowledge is power, and the more we have on
ourselves, the easier we can create conditions for maximum productivity and success.
Know your mood too. If you feel in the mood to write, go with that flow – you may write
twice as quickly and three times as well.

## Avoid visual distractions


When you need to engage in deep work, the most likely distraction is a visual one.
So hide the phone, turn off pop-up alerts, and put some headphones on to signal to
colleagues that you’re in your own zone. If there’s something else in your field of vision
that might grab your attention (like a clock or a permanent news channel on a big
monitor), remove it or reposition yourself so it’s not bothering you.

## run meetings well


More often known as time-wasting, sleep-inducing group torture sessions, meetings
are frequently badly run. It’s a lose-lose and a waste of everyone’s time. However, if
run effectively, meetings can be a powerful tool for team motivation, morale and (you
guessed it) productivity. Set a clear agenda for the meeting, and set goals at the end
with clear assignments, so everyone knows what they need to do by the next meeting.
You can also banish devices, send out important information in advance, be more
selective about attendees, and merciless with timekeeping.

## Batch similar tasks


Jumping from one disparate task to the next is inefficient and wastes precious brain

This is a little mind hack you can employ with yourself to laser-focus your efforts and

## Effective above efficient


Before getting efficient, first prioritise effectiveness. Efficiency allows you to do some­
thing quickly and well, but effectiveness determines what you choose to do in the first
place and how well you do it. It’s no use being hyper efficient at a task that has little to
no effectiveness when it comes to achieving your goals. Decide on what is effective first.
And carrying out a dry/quick-&-dirty/rehearsal version of the task, be it a draft, a sketch
or a prototype, will help immeasurably with the quality and effectiveness of your final
output. No one gets it 100% right the first time.

## Change the scenery


Being slumped over a keyboard in the same artificial lighting for hours on end, day

outside in nature for a refreshing break. There have been countless studies on the
benefits of being out in nature. Even just looking out of the window can freshen you up,
while also giving your eyes a necessary break. Failing that, simply looking at an image
of a natural scene can have similar calming effects, and help you focus.

## Long breaks


While regular, short breaks are important to keep you fresh and focussed, don’t skimp on
taking a longer break during the day – typically the lunch hour. A longer break allows you
to fully unwind, and to take a 30 minute walk around outside, or a 20-minute nap, and
sit down and eat a proper meal away from your desk. These are all essential activities for
overall health and wellbeing, which will spill over positively into your work.

## Time yourself


There’s nothing like a time limit to spur you on to get more done. Setting yourself
time limits on your tasks, and then timing yourself while doing them, will inject a

about it, it will still have the effect of urging you on. And shortcuts (worth learning, for
programs like Excel, email, etc.) can save minutes each day, adding up to entire days
saved over a career.

Perfectionism is enemy to productivity. In setting goals, we should choose ones that

more incentive to pursue them, and allow us to enjoy the success of completing them.

sheet checks, or automated email forwarding. Anything that takes the effort and
decision-making out of small, everyday tasks will pay off in huge dividends over time.

## Start and end on time


Start and end on time - no exceptions. Simple rule, big results. Just knowing that
there’s no flexibility on this will change everyone’s behaviour, allowing for maximum
efficiency in the time allocated.

## Get ergonomic


It’s such a pain in the neck when you have... well, a literal pain in the neck. Sitting in an
uncomfortable chair or using equipment that is not optimised for hours on end every
day is going to have an effect on your health, physical comfort level, and ability to work
well. There are all sorts of innovations in workspaces now, including standing desks
and more ergonomic equipment. It is worthwhile investing (or getting your company to
invest in) some of these, for the good of all.

## Use your commute


Ahh the commute. The bane of every office worker’s life. This is essentially dead time,
but you can utilise this to get more things done. Rather than staring bleakly into some­
one’s armpit on the crowded train, harness this time to learn, read, work, meditate. If
you have a half-hour commute, that’s an hour every day that can be spent on any of
the above.

## Unplug


It is far too easy to get pulled into checking work emails at home, or even on the way
home on your phone. This age of constant connectedness creates a pressure to always
be productive, making unplugging a challenge. Ironically, unplugging is essential for
optimal productivity. When you’re away from work, over evenings and weekends, make
the effort to fully unplug and give your attention to your family, loved ones, and leisure
time. This is the only way to guarantee that you’ll return to work replenished and ready
to take on anything.

## Meeting roles


To ensure your meetings are productive and not soporific, assign specific roles for
participants, e.g. timekeeper, notetaker, chair. Active involvement will keep attendees
engaged, and ensure maximum group output.

## Do not do to-do lists


If it isn’t scheduled in, it isn’t getting done. To-do lists are essential in that they clarify
what needs doing (see tip #7), but they can make us feel like we’re doing something
useful when it’s really little more than procrastination disguised as productivity. Worse,
when we inevitably fail to cross off all the items on our list, they can leave us feeling
discouraged and incompetent. Instead, timetable tasks that need doing, which will
force you to get realistic about how long each item will take, and give you a structure in
which to complete them.

## 10,000 hours


Malcolm Gladwell popularised the idea that it takes 10,000 hours of dedicated practise
to master any skill. Following this principle should allow you to eliminate activities that
you are not willing to devote this much time to. Think you want to learn to play the
banjo? Willing to practise for 10,000 hours before you’re any good? If not, drop it, and
move on to your top priorities.

## Find lost hours


Reclaim time that would otherwise be lost to you. Standing in queues, travelling from
place to place, sitting in a waiting room... these pockets of time all accumulate. Make
use of them to get small things done, whether it’s listening to an interesting podcast,
reading a book, or brainstorming some new ideas.

## Short- and long-term goals


It’s difficult enough trying to keep yourself motivated, let alone an entire group of peo­
ple, like your team. Setting shared goals is a surefire way to have everyone aligned and
working together. In doing so, set both long- and short-term goals. The long term goals
are useful for giving you all a grand vision to work towards, while the short-term goals
will help keep you encouraged and sustained along the way.

## Reward yourself


For this to work you need to ensure you do only reward yourself AFTER you have com­
pleted your task, NOT before. Hands off that chocolate bar! But giving yourself a further
incentive to get your work done will only help. It’s also worth keeping records of your
completed tasks, which can often be reward enough in itself. This allows you to see the
progress you’ve made, keeping up momentum.

## Rituals


Do you brush your teeth every day? Hopefully the answer is “yes, of course!” It’s a ritual
that was probably ingrained in you by your parents from a very young age. That is the
power of a ritual – do something enough and it’ll become second nature. We don’t
need to expound the benefits of brushing your teeth, but there are other rituals whose
benefits might seem less obvious. For example, taking a minute to make your bed in
the morning. That might seem uncorrelated to being more productive at work, but it
sets you up on the right note for the day. Most high performers have rituals, and there’s
a good reason: rituals help get you into a flow state, in which you can produce your
best work.

## Eric Schmidt’s “9 Rules of Email”


Eric Schmidt, software developer and business powerhouse, created 9 rules for email.
Here are his top 5 - See if any of these make you more efficient with your inbox:

## When writing an email, every word matters, and useless prose doesn’t.


Be crisp in your delivery.

## Ask yourself, “What should I have forwarded, but didn’t?”


... Maybe you could find the rest out for yourself!

## Be flexible


Transpose popular project management methodology onto your own personal man­
agement. Being “agile” is a desired trait for any business, so why not try to be agile
yourself? The popular SCRUM agile framework sets a number of tasks in service of a
larger goal, which are completed in sprints of a week or so. Try applying that to your
own work.

## Log all your ideas


You never know when a random idea that has no application now might be a game
changer later on. Keep a log of all your ideas in a place where you can easily go back
and find and add to them, whether that’s a dedicated notebook, or a file on your com­
puter. Over time this may become an inspiring source of innovation. At the very least it
will make a fascinating collection to look back over.

## Take control when you can


Many of these tips are about exercising greater control – over yourself, or your sched­
ule, or your environment. It is important to have control where you can, as chaos and
feeling out of control are not conducive to productive work. However, it is also vital to
accept when things are not in your control, and concentrate on the things that are.

## Make work fun again


Probably the number one motivator for any activity is the amount of fun we have doing
it. Injecting fun into even the most thankless of tasks will help keep you productive
over time. It’s all about how you frame activities in your mind. You can see them as
boring, or you can gamify them. Like in a game, set yourself challenges or even invent
narratives to amuse yourself (the bomb will detonate if I do not finish this report by
midday – best to keep these in your mind though!) Or set up a bit of friendly compe­
tition with your colleagues to keep everyone extra motivated. Whatever adds some
excitement to your work.

## Listen actively


Active listening: a perpetually underrated superpower. We may take for granted that we
listen and are listened to over the course of a conversation, but you’d be surprised how
little we actually retain: research suggests that its only 25 - 50% of the things that we
hear. Active listening ensures that you are fully focused on the speaker and therefore
properly taking in what they are saying, rather than half-listening to the buzzing in your
own head. Not only will it improve your productivity, it will also improve your relation­
ships – you can’t go wrong!

## zero inbox


“Zero” doesn’t refer to the number of emails in your inbox, but the amount of time
your mind is in your inbox. Productivity expert Merlin Mann developed the Inbox Zero
technique to prevent your inbox becoming a to-do list. Choose one of five actions for
each email: delete, delegate, respond, defer and do. He also advocates not leaving
your inbox open and only checking email at certain set times of the day. Here’s Merlin
talking about it: https://youtu.be/z9UjeTMb3Yk.

## Voicemail


In a world of endless pings and text messages, answering a ringing phone can feel like
a more “legitimate” reason to allow yourself to be interrupted. But technology also
granted us another way: voicemail. Don’t feel obliged to answer phone calls if you are
deep in an important task. Let voicemail be your friend.

## Hard stuff first


Wherever you can (while allowing for deadlines), prioritise the hardest tasks. It might
be the opposite of what you want to do – it’s so satisfying powering through all the
easy and enjoyable tasks to give us a false sense of accomplishment. But by chipping
away at the hard and unpleasant ones first, you’ll get a greater sense of satisfaction
in the long term and boost your spirits and self-confidence. This also leaves the nice
things to do at the end of the day when your energy levels are probably lagging, and
the last thing you want to do is face a horrible task.

## Close open loops in your head


Open loops are tasks that need doing but have no deadline, plan or decision in place.
They can be professional or personal (a unpleasant task from your manager, an awk­
ward conversation you need to have with a friend). They are unresolved, open-ended
issues that drain your energy, cause anxiety and ultimately detract from your produc­
tivity. Close these open loops by writing them all down, and putting a plan in place.

## Waiting-on list


The waiting-on list is for those tasks that are important to you but that someone else
must do. Keep a log of such tasks as soon as you’ve delegated them, or if someone has
volunteered to do it. This technique is further strengthened if you log the dates that
the task was assigned and its agreed deadline. Avoid creating more admin for yourself
by being picky about what is on your waiting-on list (not more than a dozen). A lighter
version is to tag all actions for others with ‘WO’ so it is logged, and you can circle back
and chase up periodically.

## Reply by...


Email can derail even those with the best of intentions, because every time a new one
pings in, our instinct is to want to open and respond. However, not all emails are made
equal, and many do not require an immediate response. Try making a folder for emails
and assign those emails a day by which you will reply to them. That way, you free your­
self of the burden of feeling like you need to reply straight away, but you’ve also set
yourself a deadline to respond.

## Control your inbox


Control your inbox, don’t let your inbox control you. It is all too easy to let the con­
stant incoming flood of our inbox dictate how we spend our time. Take back control
by turning off email notifications, allocating set times in which you deal with email
(and don’t go near it outside of those times) and organising your email using folders,
or tags – whatever works for you.

## Wear a uniform


Unless your job requires you to wear an actual uniform, deciding what to wear to work
will take time out of your morning routine every day. Though the gravity of this deci­
sion depends on how fashion-conscious you are, every decision we make throughout
the day drains a little bit more of our cognitive energy, and will eventually lead to de­
cision fatigue. Avoid this by assigning yourself a work uniform. Steve Jobs was famous
for his polo neck and jeans combo, and many other successful business people do the
same. If you wear the same thing every day, that’s one less decision you have to make,
preserving energy for the many others you will need to make at work.

## Set deadlines


Set deadlines for everything, even small things. When delegating, if others don’t
know how urgent a task is they can’t know how to prioritise it, and so they won’t. This
applies whether you’re communicating with someone who works for you, your boss or
your boss’s boss. It’s a matter of clarity. Just make sure that when setting deadlines for
others you do so in a polite manner!

## Assign a ‘Task Deputy’


Much as we can try to control ourselves, there’s nothing like being held accountable
by someone else to keep us on task. Try assigning a task deputy, such as a colleague
or a friend. As long as it is someone whom you can trust to hold you mercilessly to
account when you procrastinate or do not fulfill commitments.

## Schedule “stress” time.


While some stress at work now and then is expected, excessive amounts will interfere
with your performance, and impact negatively on physical and emotional health. While
we cannot completely avoid stress, we can stay in control. To protect yourself and
improve job satisfaction and overall well-being, schedule breaks into your calendar
by time blocking. Take a few minutes of quiet time for yourself before you start work.
Schedule an exact amount of time each week and treat it like an appointment that you
can’t cancel. When you write it down and plan for it, you’re less likely to skip it.
