If you’ve ever had a manager who nurtured your abilities
and worked with you to set challenging but realistic goals,
you’ll know how much difference coaching can make to
your career – and to the success of your organization.
Coaching can help your team to communicate better,
to overcome conflict, to accept change, to think
creatively, and to work together more effectively.
But most managers are given no formal training in
coaching, and many feel daunted by the prospect of
doing it. So, they allow this essential tool for personal
and team development to fall by the wayside.
That’s why we created this How to Coach toolkit. It can
enable you to fulfill one of your key responsibilities as
a manager: helping your team members to grow, and to
realize their full potential. What’s more, you’ll likely find
that you benefit from the process just as much as they do.
I hope you enjoy it!
Coaching is a powerful way to
increase happiness, engagement
and productivity in your team.

Coaching skills are a valuable asset for any
manager. A study by Deloitte found that leaders
who frequently coached their teams improved
their business results by 21 percent.
So, it’s no surprise that an increasing number of
workplaces consider coaching to be a worthwhile
investment. In a survey by the Conference
Board Council, 61 percent of the participating
organizations used some form of internal coaching.
One reason for this increase is that people who
receive coaching can reap considerable benefits.
Research by PwC found that, of the participants
who had received coaching:
•	 80 percent had increased self-confidence.
•	 73 percent had improved relationships.
•	 72 percent had improved communication skills.
•	 67 percent reported a better work-life balance.
Numbers like these will likely appeal to any leader,
in any industry!
But, despite the evidence that effective coaching
can make a difference, most managers have very
little training in how to do it. The good news is that
coaching is a skill that you can learn.

“I haven’t got time for coaching! And who needs it,
anyway?” If this is your first reaction to what might
feel like just another burdensome task, read on.

What Will Coaching Do for Me?
We’ll tell you right now, coaching isn’t easy – at
least, not if you want to do it well. However, it can
be a rewarding and inspiring experience, especially
when you see your team racing ahead as a result.
When you coach your team members, you may
find that your own job satisfaction increases, too,
and that you have a deeper sense of purpose
and meaning at work. What’s more, you’ll likely
strengthen your relationship with your team.
But first, you need to gain the knowledge and
confidence to be an effective coach.
This workbook will guide you through the essential
coaching skills.
You will learn:
•	 How to develop good listening skills, emotional
intelligence and trust, so that you can establish
strong coaching relationships.
•	 How to coach individual team members.
•	 How to coach your whole team.
•	 How to coach yourself.
And, by working through the exercises in each
chapter, you’ll gain a deeper understanding of the
topic and reinforce what you’ve learned.
But first, let’s deal with those time pressures and
To-Do Lists that dominate your life. Consider how
a small investment now in effective, targeted
coaching can save you and your team large
amounts of time and effort in the future.
Purpose and enthusiasm will grow, errors will
decrease, and loyalty and collaboration will build.
And you’ll likely find yourself dealing with less
conflict, and delegating more.

## Coaching Skills


A report by the International Coaching Federation
shows that thousands of coaching clients valued
rapport and compatibility more highly than
a coach’s formal education, or his or her years
of experience.
This gives you an advantage – because, as
a manager, you already have good working
relationships with your team members.
But coaching requires other important
skills, too. These include:
•	 Listening.
•	 Communicating.
•	 Questioning.
•	 Emotional intelligence.
•	 Developing trust.
In this chapter, we’ll look at these skills in more
detail, and discuss how you can improve each one.
A coach is someone
who tells you what you
don’t want to hear, and
has you see what you
don’t want to see, so
you can be who you
have always known
you can be.
Tom Landry, NFL coach

## Coaching Skills
### Improving Your Listening Skills

The ability to listen well is the most important
coaching skill. It’s key to understanding what the
other person is saying on the surface, and to finding
out what he or she means on a deeper level.
Specifically, you need good active listening skills.
This means that you give your full attention to
the other person, and that you’re not distracted
by thinking of follow-up questions or counter-
arguments. You also need to be aware of the
person’s body language, and how it aligns with
(or differs from) what he says.
When you’re listening actively, give subtle clues to
show that you’re paying attention. For example, nod
your head and use words like “Yes,” or agree with
an “Uh huh,” when the person is talking. You can
also paraphrase what you’ve just heard to confirm
that you’ve understood it. For example, you might
say, “What I’m hearing is…” or, “If I understand what
you’re saying… .”
Another useful skill is empathic listening. This is
similar to active listening, but it also requires you
to make a concerted effort to understand what the
speaker is saying on an emotional level, as well as
an intellectual level.
To listen empathically, pay attention to what’s being
said – and what isn’t. Keep in mind that what the
speaker holds back is sometimes as important as
what she communicates.
Try to keep your own thoughts and opinions out
of the conversation, and to focus on the other
person. Listen carefully to his vocal tone and
inflection, and watch his facial expressions closely.
Ask yourself, “How is this person feeling about
what he’s telling me?”
Mindful listening takes this a stage further, as it
enables you to listen without judgment or criticism.
The key is to listen “in the moment” – to be aware
of your own thoughts and reactions to what is being
said without allowing them to distract you from the
speaker’s message. This ensures that you remain
open and receptive to other people’s ideas.

### Developing Good Communication Skills

To be an effective coach, you need to know how
to communicate your thoughts and ideas clearly.
The other person will rely on your expertise and
guidance, so it’s vital that you get your message
across without causing confusion.
Part of effective communication is keeping your
opinions and assumptions out of the conversation.
This is especially true in coaching, where the focus
is always on the coachee. But it’s easier said than
done, and many of us insert our opinions into
a discussion without even realizing it!
Here’s an example. Javier is talking to his coach,
Susan, about how he’s not been able to devote any
time to leadership development – a goal that both
of them agreed was important for his career.
Susan: So tell me what has happened this week.
Javier: I just couldn’t find the time to read that
leadership development book, or work on the
exercises you gave me.
Susan: Was it your boss again? Did he add more to
your workload?
Javier: Yes, he did.
Susan: That probably made you feel stressed and
unappreciated, right?
Javier: Yes, it doesn’t make me feel good when he
does that. I already have too much to do.
At first, it might seem that Susan correctly identified
that Javier’s problem was his boss. But, if you look
more closely, you’ll see that Susan assumed that this
was the case. Then, she steered the conversation
in a particular direction with her suggestion that the
increased workload made Javier feel “stressed
and unappreciated.”
By asking a different set of questions, Susan could
have helped Javier to come to his own realization
about his time management – which might have
had nothing to do with his boss!
This simple example shows how easy it is to
influence a conversation with your choice of
words, phrases and questions.
You can avoid this in your coaching conversations
by learning to use Clean Language. This technique
was developed by David Groves in the 1980s,
and it enables coaches to avoid using words and
metaphors that might affect their clients’ thoughts
and feelings.
The Clean Language technique is useful because it
helps the coachee to arrive at his own realizations,
without being influenced by you. This allows him to
develop greater self-awareness, and means that
he will more likely identify the real cause of his
problems correctly.
Try to limit your own use of metaphors when
you’re coaching. But do pay close attention to the
metaphors that your coachee uses, as they can
offer powerful clues to how he feels about the
subject you’re discussing.

### ACTION

For the next few days, pay attention to the metaphors that you use in your everyday speech. Write
them down in the table, below.
Here are a few examples of common metaphors:
•	 I can’t digest what you’re telling me.
•	 I need to build my leadership skills.
•	 I’m trapped in my job.
•	 She’s sticking her head in the sand.
•	 I’m over the moon about my promotion.
It can be a challenge to identify metaphors,
because we use them so often. Some are so
ingrained in the way we talk that we don’t even
realize we’re using them! But listen out for them
in your coaching sessions, as they might help
you to identify your team member’s hidden or
subconscious thoughts.
Metaphors

How to Coach: a Manager’s Guide

Page 13 of 58
When your coachee uses a metaphor, you can ask
a series of Clean Language questions that will help
you to understand his meaning. These are:
•	 And is there anything else about…?
•	 And what kind of… is that…?
•	 And where is…?
•	 And whereabouts?
•	 And what happens next?
•	 And then what happens?
•	 And what happens just before…?
•	 And where could… come from?
•	 And that’s like… what?
When you use Clean Language, speak more slowly
and in a slightly deeper voice than your team
member, and try to mimic her intonation and body
language as much as possible. This can help her to
relax and open up to you.
Using Clean Language takes practice, and some of
the questions may sound a bit awkward at first. If
so, role-playing can help you to get used to them.

Practice the Clean Language technique with
a friend or colleague. Pay attention to his
metaphors, and to any words or phrases that
might indicate how he feels. Ask Clean Language
questions to get to the root of any issues.

## How could active listening improve your relationships in your personal and professional lives?
### Asking Better Questions

Great coaches listen more than they talk. And they
ask the right questions at the right times – this helps
their coachees to understand themselves better.
When you ask questions, your goal is to find out
information that can help your team member. Don’t
take it as an opportunity to voice your own opinions!
Concentrate on asking open-ended questions.
These are questions that the other person can’t just
reply “Yes” or “No” to, and which require her to give
a more thoughtful answer. They usually begin with
“What?” “Why?” or “How?”
Then, probe for more information with follow-up
questions. Ask your coachee for more detail, to
provide an example, or to clarify what he has said.
Good questioners also give people adequate time to
respond. When you’re coaching, make sure that you
pause after you ask a question to give your coachee
time to think. Don’t be tempted to fill the silence!

### Learning Emotional Intelligence

Emotional intelligence is about recognizing your
emotions, understanding why you feel a certain
way, and knowing how your behavior affects those
around you. It’s also about sensing others’ wants
and needs.
When you have emotional intelligence, you can
develop stronger relationships, control your
emotions more effectively, and know yourself
better. All of these elements allow you become
a better coach.
Emotional intelligence is made up of five elements:

## Self-Awareness – The ability to look inward, to


think deeply about your behavior, and to consider
how it aligns with your ethics and values.

## Self-Regulation – This determines the extent to


which you can control your emotions, feelings
and impulses.

## Motivation – People who have high emotional


intelligence know how to exchange immediate
gratification for long-term success. If you focus
on building this skill, you can coach others to do
the same.

## Empathy – Putting yourself in other people’s


shoes, and gaining a better understanding
of their perspectives. This trait is incredibly
important in coaching.

## Social Skills – People with high emotional


intelligence know how to build and maintain
good relationships.

### Building Trust

Your coaching relationships with your team
members are built on confidentiality and trust. The
process only works if your coachee is comfortable
sharing his thoughts and feelings with you. If you
don’t have trust, this won’t happen.
There are several ways to build trust in a relationship:
•	 Be honest. People will trust you if they know that
they can count on you to tell the truth.
•	 Share your experiences. Tell them about the time
you made a mistake, or experienced a failure. You
can also talk about your values or beliefs.
•	 Keep your word. If you make a promise to
someone, do whatever it takes (within reason!) to
stick to it. If you can’t, be upfront and explain why.
•	 Inspire others. Demonstrate behaviors such
as integrity, respect, loyalty, fairness, and
authenticity.
We’ll learn more about how to develop trust in the
next chapter.

### Drawing This Together

In this chapter, we learned about the skills that
you need to be a great coach, including how to
listen, communicate, question, develop emotional
intelligence, and build trust. These are all important
for connecting with other people, and to maintain
positive relationships.
In the next chapter, we’ll look at the coaching
process itself.
Which of the skills (listening, communicating, questioning, developing emotional intelligence, and building
trust) do you think you struggle with the most? Why?
What can you do to improve these skills?

## Coaching Individuals


One-on-one coaching is a great way to provide this
guidance. It’s the most common form of coaching,
and it’s valuable in many ways. For example, it can
help your team members to:
•	 Identify career goals, and develop plans to
achieve them.
•	 Improve their time-management and
organizational skills.
•	 Find the right work-life balance.
•	 Make better decisions.
•	 Develop skills to work more effectively.
•	 Reduce stress.
•	 Build more productive work relationships.
•	 Think positively.
In an individual coaching relationship, it’s important
that you are humble, and that you always respect the
other person’s opinions. Never assume that you have
the “right” answer. Make suggestions, but think of
yourself as a partner, not a teacher. Remember that
most of the time, the solutions to whatever issues
your team members have lie within themselves.
In this chapter, we’ll look at some useful models that
you can use to frame your one-on-one coaching
conversations. We’ll also discuss how to build
successful coaching relationships, and how you can
use coaching techniques informally, as well as in
structured sessions.
Deep down, your team members likely already
know the answers to their problems. As a coach,
your job is to guide them toward this realization.

## Coaching Individuals
### Useful Coaching Models

You may feel a little daunted by the prospect of
coaching another person. After all, if you’re like
most leaders, you probably haven’t received
any formal coaching training. So, how do you
know what to do or say to guide your team
member effectively?
Fortunately, there are many established models,
techniques and approaches that you can use to
structure your coaching sessions.

## The GROW Model


The GROW Model is a simple, yet powerful,
coaching tool. GROW stands for:
•	 Goal.
•	 Current Reality.
•	 Options (or Obstacles).
•	 Will (or Way Forward).
As a manager, you’ve likely already identified
many of your team member’s issues, and that’s
OK. You can still use the GROW Model as a guide
that can help her to explore ideas, to come to her
own conclusions, and to identify what she wants
to achieve.
To use the GROW Model, follow these steps:

## Agree a plan. The coachee identifies the steps


that he needs to take, and commits to specific
actions that will move him toward his goal. At
this point it’s useful to discuss how he will stay
motivated, and the strategies that he’ll use to
overcome any obstacles that arise. Finally, set
a date to review his progress, and to revise the
plan if necessary.

## Agree a plan. The coachee identifies the steps
### ACTION

Use the GROW Model to identify your own
challenges and issues. In the table, below, write
down the questions you ask yourself as you
work through the process. These can be a useful
starting point for coaching other people.
•	 Guide – This approach is best for people who
have high will, but low skill.
•	 Delegate – Use this with people who have high
skill and high motivation.
•	 Direct – Use this approach with people who
have low skill and low will.
•	 Excite – Use this for people who have high skill,
but low motivation.
For example, if you are working with someone in
the Direct quadrant, you might want to set clear
guidelines, manage her progress closely, and
encourage her to discuss any deadlines with you.
But you could take a more “hands off” approach
to coaching a team member who falls into the
Delegate quadrant.

Books, 2003. Reproduced with permission.

## The Skill/Will Matrix


Your team members all have their own needs,
personalities, skills and abilities. This means that
you will need to tailor your approach to fit each
individual.
The Skill/Will Matrix, developed by coach and
author Max Landsberg in 2003, can enable you
to find the appropriate coaching style for every
situation.
The matrix (see figure 1, right) is divided into four
quadrants. Each quadrant represents a different
coaching style:
Figure 1 – The Skill/Will Matrix

## The Skill/Will Matrix
### ACTION

Think about the people in your team. Where would you place each of them on the Skill/Will Matrix?
Plot each one in the table, below.

## Solution-Focused Coaching


The Solution-Focused Coaching approach helps
you to identify what your team member wants, and
how he can achieve it. Your aim is not to examine
why a specific problem is occurring, but to find
a solution. This helps you to avoid dwelling on the
negatives. It’s a simple and positive way to coach
someone.
There are four steps in a solution-focused approach:

## Change what isn’t working.


This model is effective for most people, in most
situations. However, if your team member wants to
explore the deeper issues behind her behavior or
actions, you might want to take a different approach.

## Change what isn’t working.
### Setting up a Coaching Relationship

Trust and rapport are two of the most important
aspects of a successful coaching relationship.
Without them, your team member is unlikely to
share his thoughts and feelings with you.
Building Trust
There are several ways to develop trust with your
team member:
Demonstrate Your Credibility
Your coachee needs to feel that you have the
knowledge and skills to help her. That is why
credibility is so important.
Your existing relationship with your colleague likely
makes you a credible coach, but remember that
your role as a coach is very different from your role
as a manager.
In your coaching sessions, show confidence
by avoiding hesitation, making eye contact,
and smiling. But, if you don’t have all the answers,
don’t be afraid to admit it. If you’re open and
honest with your team member, your credibility will
increase. What’s more important is that you have
the resources to find the answers together.
Show Your Reliability
Another important aspect of building trust is
reliability. Your team member needs to know that
he can depend on you, in every situation.
To show that you’re reliable, make sure that you
do what you say you’ll do, without fail. Be sure
to turn up for your coaching sessions on time, to
return messages and calls promptly, and to remain
sensitive to your coachee’s preferences and
expectations.
Make the Other Person Comfortable
When your team member feels secure and
comfortable, she’s more likely to open up and
share what she’s really thinking. This only tends to
develop once you know someone well.
You can help this process along by sharing some
personal information about yourself, too. This
doesn’t mean that you have to self-disclose every
detail about your life! But telling stories from your
past, or talking about your values and beliefs,
will show that you trust her with your personal
information.
You need to find the right balance between how
much to tell her and how much you keep to yourself.
Use the Johari Window model to help with this.
Show That You Care
Your coachee needs to feel that you have his best
interests at heart, and that your relationship isn’t
just about improving the quality of his work or
increasing his productivity.
So, take an active interest in his life. Be clear that
you are available at short notice if he needs to talk
to you. And, if your coaching plan takes longer
than you expect to bear fruit, be patient and
demonstrate your commitment to the process.

Building Rapport
At the start of a coaching relationship, it’s important
to build a rapport with your team member. But this
can be more difficult than it sounds!
To help the process along, find out what the two
of you have in common. You can do this by asking
her questions about herself, and about what’s
happening in her life.
The six levels of rapport were originally identified
by Gregory Bateson in 1964, and developed further
by Robert Dilts in 1990. They are:

## Environment – What do you have in common


(work, location, background, and so on)?

## Spirit – Do you have a similar spiritual outlook


on life?

## Spirit – Do you have a similar spiritual outlook
### ACTION

Answer the questions below to learn how to build
trust and rapport with your team member.

## One of the best ways to put your team member at ease is by self-disclosing. List some examples of


personal information that you’re comfortable sharing.

## Think about what you’ve learned from these managers. Do any of their approaches or techniques seem


appropriate for you? If so, which ones, and why?

## Think about what you’ve learned from these managers. Do any of their approaches or techniques seem
### Informal Coaching

You don’t have to wait for a structured session to
use your coaching skills. Good coaches engage
with their team members daily, or weekly.
These informal coaching sessions might be quick,
but they can make a huge difference to your team’s
effectiveness and morale. They can also help you
to create stronger and more trusting relationships
with your people.
You can identify informal coaching opportunities in
several ways:

## Keep on Top of Workloads


Stay in touch with your team members’ workloads.
When people are overloaded, or they’re trying
to juggle too many responsibilities, an informal
coaching session can help them to prioritize their
tasks, or to gain a clearer understanding of what’s
most important.
Adjust your schedule during busy times so that
you’re available to help when your team members
need you.

## Be Aware of People’s Moods


A change in a person’s mood might prompt you to
start an informal coaching conversation.
For example, imagine that you’ve walked by a team
member’s desk. His shoulders are slumped,
his head is down, and he’s staring blankly at his
computer screen. Sure, he may just be recovering
from a big lunch! Or, he might have just learned that
his most promising client went to your competitor.
The point is, his body language is telling you that
something is wrong. If he’s just eaten too much, you
could encourage him to take a quick walk outside.
But, if it’s something more serious, you’re in the right
place at the right time for a quick coaching session.
There are many situations where people can
benefit from an informal coaching conversation –
for example, when they’ve received feedback, or
after a performance review. Team members might
also need support if they experience an anticlimax
after achieving a major goal, or if a project or
presentation didn’t go as well as they’d hoped.

## Ask for Permission


Informal coaching can be a valuable experience
for your team member. However, she might
not appreciate it if she’s in the middle of doing
something important!
Be sure to check that it’s a good time to have
a coaching conversation.

## Ask for Permission
### ACTION

Consider what you’ve learned about informal coaching sessions, and then check in with your team
members on the “shop floor.” (Read our article, Management by Wandering Around, if you are
concerned about how to do this without appearing to interfere or “spy on” your team.) Then, answer
the questions below.

## Don't Tell People What to Do


Remember, your goal as a coach is not to offer
advice or to give specific instructions. The best
coaches ask questions, and listen more than
they talk.
If you find yourself using the words “I think…” during
a coaching session, you may need to re-examine
your approach.

## Use Informal Moments


The best time to have an informal coaching
conversation is when you both feel relaxed. Rather
than organize a formal meeting, you could talk to
your team member over a cup of coffee in your
break room, or during lunch, instead.
The goal here is to be relaxed, while remaining
professional.

### Drawing This Together

In this chapter, we discussed how to coach an
individual member of your team. We outlined
several models to guide your approach, and found
out how to get your coaching relationships off to
a great start. We also explored building trust and
rapport with your team members.
The next chapter focuses on how to coach a team.
We’ll look at how group coaching works, and
examine several models and processes that you
can use to do it.

## What could you have done better?

biggest challenge? And how will you overcome it? Write down your answers in the box, below.

## Coaching Teams


When your people aren’t working together as
effectively as they could, team coaching can help.
Instead of focusing on individual development,
your attention with group coaching is on improving
relationships and interactions within the team as
a whole.
Team coaching is useful in many situations. For
example, it can help people to:
•	 Work through interpersonal conflicts.
•	 Understand their roles within the group.
•	 Improve relationships.
•	 Understand team goals.
You can coach your people at a specific place and
time – at a team-building event, for example – or
you can do it spontaneously.
In this chapter, we discuss some of the causes of
conflict within teams, and the tools that you can
use to resolve it. We also examine the importance
of defining your expectations, and how to manage
clashes of values in cross-functional teams.
It’s not easy to get a team to work to its full potential.
Conflicts, power struggles and miscommunication
can cause a group to start, stumble and stop.

## Coaching Teams
### Understanding Team Dynamics

Before you start your group coaching session,
you need to know how your people relate to one
another.
Each person has a unique personality and way of
communicating. But, when people are in a group,
they have to work closely with one another. Their
different styles can cause frustration and conflict,
which may prevent them from working together
effectively.
By understanding team dynamics, you can help
people to recognize how they relate to one another,
and to identify ways to improve their relationships.
Recognizing Unique Personalities
Personality tests such as Myers-Briggs®, the Big
Five Personality Traits Model, and The DiSC Model
can help you and your team members to learn more
about how you prefer to communicate and process
information.
If your team members agree to take these tests, and
to share the results, they may learn to understand
one another better, and that it’s OK for individuals
to have different preferences. This can enable them
to work together more effectively.
Let’s look at an example. Patrick is detail-oriented,
and enjoys compiling facts and doing research.
This sometimes annoys his colleagues, because
they think he can be too slow to finish his work.
But, when they realize the benefit that the team
gets from his attention to detail, they begin to
see it as a strength rather than a weakness.
It can also help if each team member understands
her “role” within the group, and whether it’s Action
Oriented, People Oriented or Thought Oriented.
The nine specific roles that underpin team success
were identified in the 1970s by Dr Meredith Belbin,
and you can learn about them in our article, Belbin’s
Team Roles.

## Coaching Teams
### ACTION

Ask your team members to identify their strengths in relation to the team as a whole. Then, read about
Belbin’s team roles and pick the role that you think each team member plays within your group. List
them in the table, below.
Another useful technique for matching and
balancing team roles and individual preferences
is the Margerison-McCann Team Management
Profile. This tool is similar to Belbin’s Team Roles,
and is based on the same principles: that people
have different strengths, and that a well-balanced
team includes a variety of preference types.

Prepare a team charter by answering the
questions below and on the next page.

## Coaching Teams
### Defining Your

Expectations
When your team members understand one
another better, they will likely work together more
effectively. But they may also benefit from a set of
ground rules that guides the way that they behave
and communicate.
​For instance, let’s say that Rudi finds high-energy
meetings exhausting and intimidating. He’s also the
technical expert. The group needs to know when
it’s veering off course, and Rudi’s input is crucial.
But, it’s difficult for him to speak up against the
group. In the past, he has stayed silent when he
could have raised the alarm, and this has damaged
the team’s reputation.
This highlights the importance of defining
your expectations regarding behavior and
communication. In our example, you would tell
Rudi that he needs to give clearer guidance to
the group, and to speak up when he knows that
things are going wrong.
You can set out your expectations in a team charter.
This is a document that defines the behavior and
communication “rules” that everyone in the group
is expected to follow and support.
If a written charter isn’t appropriate, you can discuss
and agree acceptable standards of behavior for
different situations with your team members. For
example, you might talk about how to manage
conflict, and what to do if someone isn’t pulling
her weight.

## What kind of behavior do you expect from your people? What will you not tolerate? Outline your


expectations, below.

## List each person’s responsibilities and what he is expected to deliver, below:


Responsibility
Outcome
Priority

## Give each responsibility listed above a score between one and five, with one as the highest priority and


five as the lowest.

## What resources and support are available to your team?


Team Members’ Feedback

## What resources and support are available to your team?
### ACTION

When you have completed your team charter,
give everyone a copy and schedule a meeting to
talk about its contents. Ask for your team’s input,
and write down these ideas in the box, below.

Answer the questions below to determine whether your team is facing any competing priorities.

## What resources and support are available to your team?
### Evaluating Rewards and Recognition

At times, people in your team might have
competing priorities, and this can lead to serious
dysfunction within the group.
For instance, your organization might promote
teamwork but reward individual performance.
So, what happens when some people put their
personal goals before those of the team, to get
recognition or a bonus?
Here’s another example: in a cross-functional team,
each member has goals and priorities within the
group, as well as from their “home” departments.
Conflict can arise if these objectives are at odds.
As a manager, it’s important to identify any
competing values or goals in your team, and to
address them before they cause problems.

## Look at how your organization recognizes and rewards good performance. Does the system clash with the


goals and objectives of your own team? If so, how can you resolve this conflict?

## If you’re leading a cross-functional team, look at the reward system within each department. Are there


any conflicts?

## Make a list of your team goals, as well as each person’s objectives. Are they aligned? If not, where is


the mismatch?

## Make a list of your team goals, as well as each person’s objectives. Are they aligned? If not, where is
### Team Coaching Processes

There are various models that you can use when
you coach a group, and some of the models that
we outlined in Chapter 2 can also apply to team
coaching. Here are some further suggestions:

## The POSITIVE Model of Coaching


The POSITIVE Model of Coaching was developed
by Vincenzo Libri in 2004. You can use it to
establish highly motivating goals for your team.
The model has eight steps:
•	 Purpose – Decide what you want to achieve.
What is your goal?
•	 Observations – Think about your situation.
What is going well? What isn’t?
•	 SMART – Set a SMART goal (Specific,
Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and
Time Bound).
•	 Insight – Consider your goal. Are you excited
about it? Is it challenging?
•	 Team – Look at the people around you. Who
else will support you in achieving your goal?
•	 Initiate – When will you start to work on your
goal? How will you begin? How long will you
spend on it each week?
•	 Value – Break the goal down into smaller steps
and quick wins. How will the team celebrate
success?
•	 Encourage – Meet your team members
regularly to encourage them, and to address
any difficulties that they encounter.
Use the POSITIVE Model when your team needs
to stay motivated to achieve long-term goals. Note,
however, that the framework is less effective for
dealing with issues such as interpersonal conflicts.

## The PRACTICE Model of Coaching


The PRACTICE Model of Coaching was published
by psychologist Stephen Palmer in 2008, and
is based on an earlier approach developed by
Barbara Wasik.
You can use this simple framework to enable
your team to identify a problem, and to decide on
a solution. The seven steps are:

## Evaluate.


The biggest advantage of this model is that it’s
solution-focused. Unlike the POSITIVE Model, it’s
best for dealing with specific problems.

## Evaluate.
### TIP

Use the PRACTICE model next time your team
has a particular issue or problem that you want
to address.

## Evaluate.
### Drawing This Together

In this chapter, we learned how coaching can
enable your team to perform to its full potential.
Team coaching concentrates on interactions
and relationships that help people to work better
together, rather than on individual development.
Keep in mind that coaching is really nothing
more than a focused conversation. And, while it
can be helpful to plan a group coaching session,
don’t forget to take advantage of “on the fly”
conversations at the end of a team meeting, or
during a group lunch, for example.
The next chapter focuses on another good use
for many of the skills and techniques that you’ve
learned so far – coaching yourself!

## Evaluate.
### ACTION

What issues do you have with your team that you could resolve with coaching? How could it help?
Write down your ideas, below.

## Coaching Yourself


As we’ve seen, the coaching process can boost
your team members’ confidence, build their self-
awareness, and help to keep them motivated. So
why stop there?
Using the skills you’ve learned to coach yourself is
a great way to “practice what you preach” with your
team. And, as a role model, your people will be
inspired to achieve their goals when they see you
fulfilling yours.

## Coaching Yourself
### Identifying Your

Strengths and Weaknesses
Before you begin any journey, you need to know
your starting point. It’s the same with coaching.
When you begin to coach yourself, you have to
understand your strengths and weaknesses.
When you know what you’re good at, you can use
those strengths to achieve your goals. And when
you identify your weakest areas, you can come
up with strategies to address them, or to minimize
their impact.
A coach’s role is to solve problems, identify goals and
put action plans into place. Once you’ve learned to
use these skills, you can apply them to yourself, too.

## Coaching Yourself
### ACTION

Perform a Personal SWOT Analysis. List your biggest strengths and weaknesses in the table, below.
My Weaknesses

Use the table, below, to work through each step in the GROW Model.
Identify Your Goal
Decide on a SMART goal that you’d like to achieve.
Goal:
Identify Your Current Reality
What is happening right now? How does your situation affect you achieving your goal?
Have you already taken steps toward this goal? If so, what happened?


Does the goal conflict with any of your other objectives?
Explore the Options
What can you do to achieve your goal? How can you utilize your strengths? List your ideas, below.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of each option?


Which option seems best? Why?
What obstacles do you face? How might your weaknesses hinder your progress? What can you do to
address them?
What do you need to start doing to achieve your goal?

What do you need to stop doing to achieve your goal?
Establish the Will
What is your first step? When will you start?
Once you begin, what could hinder your progress? What will you do to overcome it?

How will you review your progress? And how often?
What will you do to make sure that you stay on track?

## Coaching Yourself
### The GROW Model

In Chapter 2, we discussed how to use The GROW
Model in one-on-one coaching sessions. But you
can use it to coach yourself, too.
The GROW Model can help you to identify a goal
and to decide on a plan of action to achieve it. If
you use this model, be sure to set aside time each
week to “check in” with yourself and assess your
progress.
Step 1: Identify Your Goal
Your first step is to identify the goal that you want to
achieve. This could be a behavior that you want to
change, or a new skill that you want to develop.
Make sure your goal is SMART: Specific, Measurable,
Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.
Step 2: Identify Your Current Reality
Next, look at your situation. This is your starting
point. Examine the factors that might help or hinder
your progress toward this goal.
Step 3: Explore the Options
Now, you need to think about how you will
reach your goal. Identify as many different ways
as possible to do so.
Step 4: Establish the Will
Create a strategy to achieve your goal. Having
a plan of action will boost your confidence and
motivation. Check your progress regularly.

## Your Coaching Action Plan


You’ve covered a lot of ground in this toolkit – well
done! But what practical difference will it make to
you and your team?

We’ve seen that coaching can vary from a quick
exchange in the moment, through regular one-on-
ones, or a substantial series of team sessions.
But, in all cases, you’ll need to be able and willing
to give it the time and thought it deserves.
So, think back to the Introduction and complete the following sentences.
Coaching excites me because…
I could personally gain…
It’s worthwhile investing time and energy in coaching my team, because…

You’ll likely need to make some changes to your
day-to-day schedule, to help you to find time for
coaching. So, be honest with yourself about your
situation and complete the following sentences.
I need to give more time to coaching my people, so the habit or process that I need to stop or change
first, is…
The blockers to change that I might have to deal with are…
I need the support of…
The Mind Tools Time Management resource(s) that might help me the most is/are…
and my first step to tackling them is to...
to make and sustain these changes, so I’m going to discuss this with him or her by...

In Chapter 1, we focused on the key skills that make
a great coach. Summarize your findings and actions
by completing the following sentences.
Listening well is crucial to good coaching. My strongest skill in this area is…
I’ll develop my active listening, empathic listening, or mindful listening by applying these top two tips in my
next one-on-one…
When I notice myself making an assumption about what my coachee means, I’ll…
I’ll add new, non-leading questions to my usual list, including…

Sometimes I find my coachees’ emotions difficult to deal with. When they express…
And my own preoccupations or mood can get in the way of an open conversation. I’m often thinking about/
feeling…
My coaching will be more effective if my coachees trust me. I can help to build trust by…
or…
I feel…
So, I’ll start managing such situations better by…
My particular strengths at work are...
and…
I can apply these to my coaching by…

You’ll make best use of your and your coachee’s
valuable time if you follow a structured approach.
So, compare the three coaching models described
in Chapter 2 and consider which you could apply
first, and how.
I plan to use the...
because…
model one-on-one with...
I’ll need to prepare by…

Whichever model you apply, be careful to build
rapport as well as trust, and to help your coachee
to feel at ease before you start.
I can show my coachee that I have his or her best interests in mind by…
I will demonstrate my integrity and humility as a coach by…
Tips from successful coaches in my organization that I’d feel comfortable applying include...
and…

Remember that you can also coach informally,
day to day, as the need arises. But your success
will depend on your awareness of your team
members’ workload and their preferred learning
styles, as well as being sensitive to the wider
working environment and culture.
I’ll avoid being isolated from life on the shop floor by…
I can improve my judgment about when to intervene by…

Most people think of coaching as an exclusive,
one-on-one activity, but you can apply it to groups
too, as we saw in Chapter 3.
I plan to use coaching with this team/group...
Together, we’ll draw up a team charter so that we can work effectively toward a common goal. The steps that
we’ll follow are…
I’ll prepare by finding out about team members’ personality styles using the following model or test...
I will discuss conflicting priorities with…
to help it to work on this topic or issue…
and by helping people to appreciate one another’s strengths and preferences.

As with one-on-one coaching, a formal structure
can help to keep your team coaching on track.
Helping people to explore their ideas, goals,
strengths, and weaknesses will likely inspire you
to think about your own situation, too. In fact, you’ll
need to demonstrate that you’re willing and able
to do this if you are to be a good role model. When
you’ve looked back at Chapter 4, record your
initial findings and decisions, below.
I plan to try out the POSITIVE model at this upcoming meeting...
My SWOT analysis highlighted...
The goal I’m working toward using GROW is...
and the PRACTICE model in this session…
As a result, I will…
and my first action is…

Finally, come back to this workbook in a month’s
time and write down what difference you’ve seen
in your and your team’s performance following
your coaching. Then, review your plan and put the
rest of it into action!
I’ve set myself a reminder to look back at this toolkit on...
Changes that I’ve seen in myself and my work include…
Changes that I’ve seen in my team’s behavior and performance include…
